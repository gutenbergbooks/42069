<h1 title="">Janet Hardy in Hollywood</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br /><i>Chapter I</i>
<br />&ldquo;THE CHINESE IMAGE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Winter hung on grimly in the Middle West
that year. Late March found the streets piled
high with snow and on that particular morning
there was a threat of additional snow in the air
as Janet Hardy, a blond curl sticking belligerently
out from under her scarlet beret,
hurried toward school.</p>
<p>It was an important day for members of the
senior class of the Clarion High School, for Miss
Williams, the dramatics instructor, was going
to hand out parts to read for the class play.
For that reason, Janet walked more briskly than
usual and she failed to hear footsteps behind her
until another girl, running lightly, called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow up a minute, Janet. I&rsquo;m nearly breathless.
I&rsquo;ve been chasing you for more than a
block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet turned to greet Helen Thorne, who
lived half a block beyond her own home and on
the same broad, comfortable thoroughfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>The girls fell into step, Janet slowing her
pace until Helen could recover her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What chance do you think we&rsquo;ll have of
getting parts in the play?&rdquo; asked Helen, her
face reflecting her hopefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as good as any of the rest,&rdquo; replied
Janet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are any Ethel
Barrymores in school and I wouldn&rsquo;t worry if
there were. I won&rsquo;t be heart-broken if I don&rsquo;t
get a part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to say, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll be
pretty much disappointed if I don&rsquo;t get one.
You have the <i>Weekly Clarion</i> to keep you
busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does that all right,&rdquo; conceded Janet, who
was editor of the page of high school news
which appeared once a week in the local daily
paper, the <i>Times</i>, under the title of &ldquo;The
Weekly Clarion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls turned into the street which led up
the hill to the high school, a sprawling brick
structure which covered nearly a block. The
original building had been started in 1898 and
as the city had grown additions had been made,
seemingly at random, until hardly any one
knew how many rooms there were and it was
not unusual for a new student to get lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Janet was slightly taller than Helen. Her
hair was a golden blond with just enough of a
natural curl to make her the envy of most of
the girls in school. Her blue eyes had a friendly,
cheery look and her mouth had an upward
twist that made it easy for her to smile.</p>
<p>Helen was a complement to Janet, with dark
brown hair, brown eyes and a dusky skin. Because
of her brunette coloring, she inclined to
gayer colors than her blond companion.</p>
<p>It was half an hour before school when they
reached the building, but a goodly number of
seniors were already on hand and competition
for r&ocirc;les in the play would be intense. With
132 in the senior class, not many more than a
score could hope to win parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many it&rsquo;s going to be a discouraging
business,&rdquo; said Helen as they went upstairs
to the chemistry auditorium where the class
was to meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a lot of the others think that, it will be
easy for us,&rdquo; smiled Janet. &ldquo;Come on, tell yourself
you&rsquo;re going to win a part and you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to for Dad&rsquo;s sake. He wrote that he
would be home for my graduation and would
attend all of the senior activities. So I&rsquo;ve just
got to make the play cast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up that kind of a spirit and you&rsquo;re as
good as in,&rdquo; encouraged Janet, who secretly
confessed that it was going to be quite a job to
win a place in the play.</p>
<p>The chemistry auditorium was well filled
when they arrived. Almost every senior girl
was there and at least half of the boys.</p>
<p>Janet looked around the large room, gauging
the mettle of the girls they would have to
compete against. Well up toward the rostrum
was Margie Blake, petite and blond and exceedingly
vivacious. Margie was popular, confessed
Janet, and probably stood a good chance
of winning a part in the play for she had innate
dramatic ability, while Janet, who had
taken a leading r&ocirc;le in the junior play, had been
compelled to study each bit of action carefully.</p>
<p>Near Margie was Cora Dean, a pronounced
brunette, who had already announced that she
intended to have a leading r&ocirc;le, and Cora had
a reputation of getting whatever she went after,
whether it was a place on the honor roll or a
part in one of the drama club&rsquo;s one act plays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Cora will be after the part I try
out for,&rdquo; whispered Helen. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s good, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a bit better than you are, and
not half as pretty,&rdquo; retorted Janet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t always win play parts on
your looks,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>Just then Miss Williams, the dramatics instructor,
hurried in. In one hand she carried
a large sheaf of mimeographed sheets while in
the other was the complete book for the play.
Several plays had been tentatively considered,
but final approval had been up to Miss Williams
and she was to announce the title that
morning as well as give out reading parts.</p>
<p>The room quieted down as a few stragglers,
coming in at the last minute, found seats at
the rear.</p>
<p>Miss Williams sorted the mimeographed
sheets into piles and at exactly 8:45 o&rsquo;clock
she rapped briskly on the desk with a ruler. The
dramatics teacher was pleasant and almost universally
liked. She smiled as she looked over
the seniors who had gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;re going to have real competition
for the play parts this year,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I suppose, though, that first you&rsquo;d like to
know the name of the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a moment, then went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read all the plays the committee recommended
carefully and my final choice is &lsquo;The
Chinese Image.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>There was a ripple of applause, for a number
of seniors, including Janet and Helen, had read
portions of &ldquo;The Chinese Image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen leaned toward her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the play I&rsquo;ve been hoping would be
selected. There&rsquo;s a part I think I can win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leading r&ocirc;le?&rdquo; asked Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly, but it isn&rsquo;t a bad part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams held up her hand and the
buzz of conversation which had started after
her announcement ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had parts for every character mimeographed
and each sheet gives sufficient reading
material for tryouts. There are 23 r&ocirc;les in
&lsquo;The Chinese Image.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m familiar with the
ability of almost all of you and if you&rsquo;ll come
up as I call your names, I&rsquo;ll give you tryout
sheets. The first sheet contains a brief synopsis
of the play with the complete cast of characters
and the second sheet has the part I want
you to try for. You will also find the hours on
the second sheet when I want you to go down
to the gym for the tryouts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Janet had to confess that she was more than
a little nervous as she waited for Miss Williams
to call her name. Senior after senior was called
up to the desk and handed his sheets. To
some of them Miss Williams added another
word or two, but she talked too low to be
heard by the main body of pupils.</p>
<p>As the tryout sheets were handed out, the
seniors left the room for it was nearly assembly
time.</p>
<p>Helen looked anxiously at Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;re going to be called? There
are less than a dozen left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know in a couple of minutes,&rdquo; replied
Janet. &ldquo;There goes Margie Blake.
Wonder what part she&rsquo;ll get a chance at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the leads, you can be sure of that.
And there&rsquo;s Cora Dean. I suppose Cora will
get the part I try for. That happened in several
of the one acts last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t last year and Cora&rsquo;s a bit too
temperamental. Well, we are going to be the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the others had been called before Miss
Williams spoke to Janet and Helen, and with a
feeling of misgiving they advanced toward her
desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br /><i>Chapter II</i>
<br />LEADING R&Ocirc;LES</h2>
<p>Miss Williams smiled pleasantly as she looked
up from the now slender pile of sheets with
the tryout parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid I was going to forget you?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were commencing to worry,&rdquo; admitted
Janet, &ldquo;for after all there&rsquo;s only one senior
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. And I&rsquo;m determined that &lsquo;The
Chinese Image&rsquo; be the best ever produced by
Clarion High.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The electric gong that heralded the opening
of school banged its lusty tone through the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about opening assembly,&rdquo; said
Miss Williams. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain to the principal
that I detained you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dramatics instructor looked quizzically
at Janet and Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make a good team, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t exactly fight,&rdquo; smiled Helen,
&ldquo;but there are times when we don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. That&rsquo;s only human. What I
mean is that when you get together with a
goal in mind, you work hard to attain that
goal. When Janet went out for editor of the
<i>Weekly Clarion</i> last fall, you were working
hard for her to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did my best,&rdquo; admitted Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it had a lot to do with my winning out
over Margie Blake,&rdquo; said Janet whole-heartedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is just the kind of spirit I&rsquo;m looking
for to put across the senior play. I&rsquo;ll have to
make a little confession or you&rsquo;ll wonder why
I&rsquo;m so intensely interested in the success of this
special play. A dramatic producing company
has made me a tentative offer, but their final
decision will be made after one of their representatives
has seen the senior play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would mean leaving Clarion,&rdquo;
protested Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it would, and while I wouldn&rsquo;t
like that, the opportunity offered by this company,
if it finally develops, would be such that
I just couldn&rsquo;t afford to reject it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of money
in teaching dramatics in a high school,&rdquo; said
Janet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough so I want to make it a life
career,&rdquo; replied Miss Williams. &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t
getting along with my plan. Helen, I&rsquo;m assigning
you for a tryout for the leading r&ocirc;le.
Here&rsquo;s your part. Read it over carefully and
be ready tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams handed the mimeographed
sheets to the astounded Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t bite,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the lead? I never dreamed you would
want me to try out for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? It calls for a brunette with
ability and brains and I think you answer that
description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams turned to Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your r&ocirc;le, Janet. It&rsquo;s the second
lead. You play a jittery little blond who hasn&rsquo;t
a brain in her head and probably never will
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that r&ocirc;le fit me?&rdquo; asked Janet, her
eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly, but I think you&rsquo;ll have a lot
of fun working on such a part. Margie Blake
is going to try for it, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will be trying for the part you&rsquo;ve
assigned me?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cora Dean. I expect that with such competition
both of you will be forced to do your
best to win the part. Maybe it&rsquo;s a little mean
of me to match you against each other this way,
but I&rsquo;ve got to have a superlative cast for the
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; promised Janet, &ldquo;for Helen
and I are going to do our best to win these
r&ocirc;les. Why Helen&rsquo;s father is planning on coming
back for graduation week and Helen&rsquo;s got
to make the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he really coming?&rdquo; asked Miss Williams,
almost incredulously, for the name of Henry
Thorne was a magic word in Clarion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s promised, and both mother and I are
counting on it. We haven&rsquo;t seen him since last
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I know one dramatics teacher who
is going to be doubly nervous the night of the
play. Just think of it&mdash;Henry Thorne, star
director of the great Ace Motion Picture Company,
watching a high school play. I&rsquo;m afraid
the cast may go all to pieces, they&rsquo;ll be so nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad&rsquo;s so entirely human,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble. Because he&rsquo;s made a
success in films, people think he must be some
kind of a queer individual who goes around
with his head in the air thinking he is better
than anyone else. He&rsquo;s just like Janet&rsquo;s father
and when he gets home he likes nothing better
than getting his old fishpole out, digging a can
of worms, and going out along the creek to fish
and doze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right, but his pictures have
been so outstanding it seems that directing them
must be some sort of a genius. I&rsquo;ve never quite
understood why you and your mother stayed
on here, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams had often wanted to ask that
question just to satisfy her own curiosity,
but the opportunity had never opened
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s working under pressure on the coast,
long hours and a terrific strain, and he says
some of the things that are said about Hollywood
are true. Most of the people are fine and
hard working, but a small, wild crowd gives the
rest a bad name and he doesn&rsquo;t want to take
any chance on my getting mixed up with that
bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Miss Williams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, but Dad thinks it best for
us to stay here in Clarion and mother and I are
happy here with all of our friends. Of course
we don&rsquo;t see a whole lot of Dad, but when he
does get home or we go out there, we have an
awfully good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams glanced at her watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 9:10. You&rsquo;d better go down to assembly.
I&rsquo;ll explain why you were late. Don&rsquo;t
forget, tryouts for both of you tomorrow
afternoon and I&rsquo;m counting on you to do your
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; promised Janet, as they picked
up the sheets with the tryout parts and left the
chemistry auditorium.</p>
<p>In the hall Helen, her dark eyes aglow with
excitement, turned to Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think; I&rsquo;ve got a chance at the leading
r&ocirc;le. Of course Cora will probably get it, but
at least Miss Williams is considering me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s stop right here,&rdquo; said Janet
firmly, &ldquo;and get one thing straight. You have
a chance at the leading r&ocirc;le.&rdquo; Helen nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora has a chance at the lead.&rdquo; Again
Helen nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on Janet, &ldquo;you are going to win
the lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you really think so?&rdquo; There was a
tinge of desperation in Helen&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are.&rdquo; Janet spoke with a definiteness
that she didn&rsquo;t quite feel, for Cora
was a splendid little actress. But Helen needed
some real encouragement and Janet knew that
if Helen felt confident from the start half of
the battle was won.</p>
<p>The morning passed in a whirl of routine
classes, but Janet found time to study her tryout
sheets for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chinese Image&rdquo; was ideally suited for
a senior play, with an excellent mystery story
to carry the action. A whole lot of dramatic
ability was unnecessary for the rapid tempo
of the story would carry along the interest of
the audience.</p>
<p>The synopsis Miss Williams had prepared was
brief and Janet read it twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chinese Image&rdquo; centered about a
strange little figure which had been brought
back from China in 1851 by Ebenezer Naughton,
then captain of one of the clipper ships
which had sailed out of Salem for far-away
ports in the Orient. The strange, squat little
figure had remained in the Naughton family
ever since for Captain Ebenezer, in his will, had
stipulated that it must never be given away or
sold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When grave troubles befall my family,
turn to &lsquo;The Chinese Image,&rsquo;&rdquo; he had written,
&ldquo;and therein you will find an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Naughtons had prospered and the
will had been almost forgotten until the family
came upon hard times and its fortune dwindled.
Two grandsons of Captain Ebenezer, now heads
of their own families, quarreled bitterly and
in the ensuing family feud the image became
involved. It finally fell to the lot of Abbie
Naughton, the r&ocirc;le played by Janet, to solve
the mystery of the image, which she did in as
thorough a manner as might have been expected
of the light-headed Abbie.</p>
<p>Janet chuckled over the lines she was to read
in the tryout. The part of Abbie should be
great fun, for Abbie did about every nonsensical
thing possible and the giddier the part
could be made, the better, decided Janet.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le was more serious, for she was
supposed to be in love with one of the boys of
the other branch of the family and many were
the trials and tribulations of their love affair.
It was a delicate r&ocirc;le, with much sweetness and
tenderness, and it should prove ideal for Helen.
Janet couldn&rsquo;t conceive of Cora Dean, who
had a certain harshness about her, getting the
part. But then, Cora was capable and she
might be able to play the r&ocirc;le to perfection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Just before noon the sky, grey since morning,
turned a more desolate shade and the clouds
disgorged their burden of snow. It was dry
and fine and tons of it seemed to be coming
down.</p>
<p>Janet met Helen in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay at school and have mine
in the cafeteria,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;How about
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t relish the long walk home, but I
didn&rsquo;t bring any money with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen smiled. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t accept a
loan, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might,&rdquo; conceded Janet, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m
more than a little hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got fifty cents. That ought to buy
enough food to last until we get home tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not going home,&rdquo; Janet reminded
her companion. &ldquo;Have you forgotten about
the roller skating party at Youde&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen flushed. &ldquo;To tell the truth, I had.
I&rsquo;ve been thinking so much about the play I
completely forgot the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not. It will be lots of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to go. If I
do, I won&rsquo;t have much time to study over my
tryout part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be an hour after school and you
haven&rsquo;t more than two paragraphs to memorize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know them now,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on and go to the party. The
bus is leaving school at five o&rsquo;clock. We&rsquo;ll be
at Youde&rsquo;s in an hour and there&rsquo;ll be a hot supper
and the skating party afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing hard,&rdquo; observed Helen, gazing
out into the swirling grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think of everything,&rdquo; expostulated
Janet. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s snowing, but the road
to Youde&rsquo;s is paved part of the way. If it
gets too thick we can turn around and come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Janet and Helen had one open period
in the afternoon which came at the same hour
and they went into the library to study their
tryout parts.</p>
<p>Janet read her lines, stopping several times
to chuckle over the nonsensical words which
Abbie Naughton was required to say in the
play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be great fun,&rdquo; she told
Janet. &ldquo;How is your part going?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand r&ocirc;le, and lots of fun. I know
the lines, but I&rsquo;m supposed to be in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be a hard part then. You
rather like Jim Barron, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what&rsquo;s that got to do with my
part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard this noon that Jim was trying out
opposite you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest true. Of course he may not get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s a grand fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;ve heard you say that before,&rdquo;
chuckled Janet. &ldquo;I have a hunch you&rsquo;ll get
that part all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen went through her r&ocirc;le while Janet
looked on with critical eyes, suggesting several
minor changes which she thought would improve
her companion&rsquo;s chances.</p>
<p>The bell for the final class period sounded
and they folded up their parts and hastened
back to the assembly. Their last class for the
day was honors English, a group of advanced
English students who also served as the editors
and reporters for the <i>Weekly Clarion</i>, writing
and editing all of the high school news which
appeared each Friday in the <i>Times</i>, the afternoon
daily paper published in Clarion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>It was the honors English class which was
sponsoring the roller skating party at Youde&rsquo;s
and Jim Barron, the sports editor, was in charge
of the plans.</p>
<p>There were seventeen in the class, including
Cora Dean and Margie Blake, who wrote the
girls&rsquo; athletic news. Miss Bruder, the instructor,
was small and dark, but somehow
she managed to keep her high-tempered class
under control.</p>
<p>This was a mid-week period and the entire
time was devoted to writing stories, which were
turned over to Janet for final editing. It was
Janet&rsquo;s task to write the headlines, a job
at which she had become exceedingly proficient.</p>
<p>Promptly at 3:30 o&rsquo;clock the final bell
sounded and writing materials were shoved
hastily aside.</p>
<p>Jim Barron stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on everyone being at the
party. The bus will be here at five o&rsquo;clock.
We&rsquo;ll stop at Whet&rsquo;s drug store on the way out
of town to pick up any of you who aren&rsquo;t here
when we start. Remember, we&rsquo;re taking the
money for the party out of the profit we&rsquo;ve
made from the <i>Weekly Clarion</i> and it won&rsquo;t
cost you a cent. Wear old clothes and plenty
of warm ones. See you here at five.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>The class scattered, some of them remaining
at school to finish up odd tasks, others hurrying
home to change clothes and prepare for the
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going home?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now. I&rsquo;m certainly not going to fall
down in these clothes while I&rsquo;m skating. I&rsquo;ve
got an old tweed suit and boots I&rsquo;m going to
wear. Why don&rsquo;t you change to your corduroys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d stay on and work on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that almost to perfection now.
Better get into some older clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen acquiesced and they donned their
winter school coats and started down the hill
toward home. The snow was still coming
down steadily, as fine and dry as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s no wind. This would drift
terribly if there was,&rdquo; said Janet, kicking her
way through the fine spume.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><i>Chapter III</i>
<br />THE WIND ROARS</h2>
<p>Janet was home in plenty of time to dress in
leisure for the skating party. Her mother
looked in once to make sure that she had plenty
of warm clothes on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re wearing that old tweed
outfit. It&rsquo;s warm and at the same time nice
looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though it&rsquo;s old, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though it&rsquo;s old. Tweed always looks
nice and that&rsquo;s an especially pretty shade of
brown. It goes so well with your hair.
Wear your scarlet beret and don&rsquo;t forget the
boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; promised Janet as her mother
started downstairs again.</p>
<p>The Hardy home was pleasant, even though
decidedly old-fashioned. There was a broad
porch completely across the front of the house.
The house itself was L-shaped, the base of the
L having been added after the original structure
was built. The exterior was shingled and creeping
vines softened the sharper angles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s room had a south exposure with two
dormer windows that added to the many angles
of the low-ceilinged rambling room. The wall
paper was pink and white with gay farm scenes
interspersed. Crisp chintz curtains were at
the windows and a gay curtain hid the large,
old-fashioned wardrobe at one end of the room
in which she kept her clothes.</p>
<p>Her dressing table was between the dormers
with a rose-colored shade on the electric light.</p>
<p>The bed, a walnut four poster, was against
the wall nearest the hall. A gay, pink-tufted
spread covered it. At one side was a small
walnut stand with a shaded reading lamp.</p>
<p>Hooked rugs, reflecting the cheery tone of
the room in their varied colors, covered the
dark, polished floor.</p>
<p>Over in the far corner, where the roof sloped
sharply, Janet had built a book case and stained
it brown. It was filled with books, arranged
in none too perfect order, showing the interest
she had in them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>But Janet had little time now to relax in the
charm of her room. Parting the curtain of
the wardrobe she found her tweed suit far to
the back. Her boots were back there too, but
they had been well oiled and were pliable.</p>
<p>From a walnut chest of drawers which stood
beside the wardrobe Janet drew woolen socks
for it was an 18-mile ride to Youde&rsquo;s and they
probably wouldn&rsquo;t be home until late.</p>
<p>Janet dressed sensibly, woolen hose, heavy
tweed skirt, a blue, shaggy wool sweater and
her tweed coat. The crimson beret would be
warm enough.</p>
<p>She glanced at the clock. She had spent
more time than she had anticipated, it was after
4:30 and Whet&rsquo;s drug store where they were
to meet the bus was a good six blocks away.</p>
<p>Janet hurried downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a cup of tea and some cookies all ready,&rdquo;
her mother called.</p>
<p>It would be after six o&rsquo;clock before they ate
and Janet drank the tea with relish. The
cookies, crisp and filled with raisins, were delicious
and she put several in the pockets of her
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put your old fur coat in the hall,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Hardy. &ldquo;Your scarf&rsquo;s there, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks mother. I&rsquo;m certainly going to be
too warm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Her mother went to the window. It was
nearly dark and the snow still swirled down
in dry, feathery clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish you weren&rsquo;t going,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be all right, mother. The bus is
large and if the weather should get bad we
could stay at Youde&rsquo;s until it clears. Remember
Miss Bruder is chaperon and she&rsquo;s extremely
sensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She needs to be with your crowd on her
hands,&rdquo; smiled her mother, following Janet into
the hall.</p>
<p>Janet slipped into her old coat. It wasn&rsquo;t
much to look at but it was warm and serviceable,
one of those bunglesome coonskins that
were so popular with college students at one
time. She twisted her scarf around her neck,
gave her mother a quick hug and kiss, and
strode out of the house.</p>
<p>Janet kicked along through the dry snow,
walking rapidly until she reached Helen
Thorne&rsquo;s home. There were no lights in the
southeast room and Janet knew that Helen
must be dressed for that was Helen&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>She whistled sharply, a long and a short, that
penetrated the quick of the twilight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>The porch light flashed on and Helen, sticking
her head out, yelled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen hurried down the walk, wriggling into
a suede jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think that will be warm enough?&rdquo; asked
Janet, who felt very much bundled up in her
coonskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my corduroy jacket underneath
and a sweater under that. I&rsquo;m practically
sealed up against the cold, but I&rsquo;ll run back
and get my old coonskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They swung along rapidly toward Whet&rsquo;s
scuffing through the dry snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like this,&rdquo; said Helen, breathing deeply.
&ldquo;The snow&rsquo;s grand and it isn&rsquo;t too cold.
Wonder if they&rsquo;ll have any heat at Youde&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the dining room will be warm, but
there&rsquo;s only a fireplace out in the room where
we skate. Wraps will probably feel good there
until we get well warmed up from skating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the haze ahead emerged the blob of
light that marked the neighborhood drug store.
As they approached they could see two or three
standing near the front door of the store.</p>
<p>Ed Rickey, captain of the football team,
jerked open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings, wanderers of the storm. Enter
and be of good cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>They stamped the snow off their boots and
stepped inside. Cora Dean and Margie Blake
were there. Boon companions, they were seldom
apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Margie, but there was no
warmth in the greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; replied Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must think you&rsquo;re going to the north
pole,&rdquo; put in Cora, as she looked Janet and
Helen over coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not quite that far, but we believe in
being sensible and warm,&rdquo; replied Helen, and
Cora&rsquo;s face flamed, for both she and Margie,
always trying to make an impression, were
dressed in fashionable riding breeches of serge.
They were pleasing to look at, but hardly the
thing for comfort on a night when the temperature
might drop almost to zero. Instead of
coats they wore zipper sweaters of angora wool.
Their boots were fashionable, but light, and
would be of little use in withstanding any
severe cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the bus,&rdquo; said Ed Rickey, who
was bundled up in nondescript clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All out that&rsquo;s going to Youde&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he bellowed,
imitating a train caller.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>The bus ground to a stop in front of the store
and the girls followed Ed across the curb. Jim
Barron opened the door. The windows of the
bus were heavily frosted for a heater was going
full blast but the driver, a middle aged man,
had a windshield wiper cutting a swath through
the frost that formed on the glass in front of
him.</p>
<p>Miss Bruder spoke as they came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; announced Jim. &ldquo;Find
your seats. Next stop at Youde&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was plenty of room in the bus for the
vehicle had a capacity of thirty and there were
only eighteen in addition to the driver. Most
of them found seats well to the fore where they
could feel the blast of warm air from the
heater.</p>
<p>Clarion was a sprawling city of 19,000, but
in less than ten minutes they had left the street
lights behind and were rolling along a smoothly
paved highway.</p>
<p>It was impossible to see out for the windows
were frosted solid, but it was a merry crowd
nevertheless. Ed Rickey, who had a fine bass
voice, started in with a school song and the
others soon joined him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Six miles outside Clarion they turned off the
main road and swung over toward the hills
which flanked the Wapsie river for it was along
the banks of the Wapsie that Youde&rsquo;s Inn was
located.</p>
<p>Their progress was slowed here for the road
had not been cleared by a snowplow. But the
snow was less than five inches deep and the
powerful bus forged ahead steadily.</p>
<p>Almost before they knew it they were over
the last hill and dropping down into the river
valley. As the bus turned into the inn, floodlights
in the yard were snapped on. A dog,
barking eagerly, leaped forward to greet
them.</p>
<p>Ed and Jim were out of the bus first, assisting
the others down. With Miss Bruder in the
lead, they trooped toward the rambling, one
story inn.</p>
<p>Eli Youde, a coonskin cap on his head, was
at the door. Behind him stood his wife, a
buxom, motherly soul of forty-five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s on the table now,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Youde as she greeted them. &ldquo;The girls can
take off their things in the room at the right;
the boys go to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were nine boys and eight girls in the
honors English class, but with Miss Bruder it
made an even number and she was so young
and full of fun that she always seemed like one
of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Cora and Margie stopped before an old fashioned
dresser to powder their noses and pat
their hair into shape, but at a skating party
these things were irrelevant to Janet and Helen
and they hastened out to join the group in the
dining room.</p>
<p>One long table had been set. There were
no place cards and the first to arrive took the
choice seats, which were near a glowing soft-coal
burner.</p>
<p>Mrs. Youde, assisted by her husband,
brought in steaming bowls of oyster stew.
Three large bowls of crisp, white crackers were
on the table, but huge inroads in them were
soon made. Conversation died away as the
stew was ladled down hungry throats.</p>
<p>Before the bowls of stew had vanished, Mrs.
Youde brought in two heaping platters of thick
sandwiches. Janet found at least three varieties
and was afraid to ask Helen how many she discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is ruining my weight, but I&rsquo;m having
a fine time,&rdquo; said Janet between bites and
Helen nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>After the sandwiches came pumpkin pie,
great thick wedges of it with a mound of
whipped cream on top and a slab of yellow
cheese at one side.</p>
<p>Ed Rickey yelled for help and when no one
volunteered to jounce him up and down to
make room for the pie, he managed to get
to his feet and trot around the table several
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to be able to bend down
and put on a skate,&rdquo; groaned Jim Barron,
who had begged a second piece of pie and was
now looking ruefully at the last crisp crust.
He wanted it, but he didn&rsquo;t quite dare and
with a sheepish look he pushed the plate away
from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better sit around a few minutes
before we start skating,&rdquo; suggested Miss
Bruder. The suggestion was welcomed and
while Mr. Youde carried armfuls of woods into
the skating rink to fill the fireplace they told
stories around the roaring fire in the heater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel better,&rdquo; announced Jim a few minutes
later. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;ll be courteous enough
to help any of you weak damsels get your skates
on. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>With Jim in the lead, they trooped into the
skating rink. The fireplace, along one wall
and halfway down the rink, was roaring lustily
as Mr. Youde piled it with fresh fuel.</p>
<p>The skates were in boxes, numbered for size,
and ranged in rows along the walls. Jim, Ed
and one of the other boys did the fitting while
the girls sat on a long bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pair that ought to be long enough
for you,&rdquo; grinned Jim as he placed a skate under
Janet&rsquo;s right foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m such a clodhopper,&rdquo;
smiled Janet. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll bet I
can beat you around the rink the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go,&rdquo; replied Jim, fastening the other
skate. &ldquo;Wait until I get the wheels under my
hoofs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet stood up and tried the skates. Jim
had found an excellent pair for her. They
felt true and speedy. She tried a preliminary
whirl. Her balance was good.</p>
<p>Jim shot out onto the floor, tried to make a
sharp turn, lost his balance, and sat down
with a thud that shook the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First down,&rdquo; yelled Ed Rickey, who hastened
to Jim&rsquo;s aid and entangled himself over
Jim&rsquo;s outstretched legs. Ed also went down
and shouts of merriment echoed through the
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ready Jim?&rdquo; asked Janet when the husky
senior was back on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as ready now as later,&rdquo; he replied and
they shot away, Janet&rsquo;s feet moving swiftly as
she got up speed.</p>
<p>Jim had the longer legs, the more powerful
strokes, but Janet was fast and light. That
might overcome the advantage of her heavier
rival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Janet, go on!&rdquo; she heard Helen
shouting as they took the first turn.</p>
<p>Jim was still ahead, but he was going too
fast for a safe turn and he skidded sharply and
lost speed at the next turn while Janet, her feet
a twinkle of motion, shot ahead. Jim yelled
in protest, but Janet only went the faster and
flashed by the finish at least two yards ahead
of the puffing Jim.</p>
<p>From then on the rink buzzed with the roll
of the skates as in couples and singly they sped
around the room.</p>
<p>Ed Rickey was a wizard on skates and after
the first rush of skating, when some of them
were content to sit on the benches near the fireplace,
he gave a demonstration of fancy skating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Janet had never imagined Ed had that
grace and sense of rhythm but the big fellow
was remarkably light on his feet.</p>
<p>Then they were back on the floor again, this
time in a series of races Jim Barron had planned,
some of them rolling peanuts the length of the
rink and back and others skating around backwards
in tandem races.</p>
<p>In spite of the roaring fire, the room was
cold and Janet felt the chill creep through her
bones. She stopped skating and edged over close
to the fireplace just as the bus driver came in
and spoke to Eli Youde. The innkeeper departed
at once with the driver and Janet heard
the bang of an outer door as though it had
been caught by the wind and closed violently.
But there had been no wind when they came
down into the valley to the inn.</p>
<p>If the wind had come up, the snow might
drift badly. She put that thought out of her
mind, and rejoined the skaters.</p>
<p>It was less than five minutes later when the
innkeeper and the bus driver returned, striding
down the center of the rink. Mr. Youde
held up one hand and the skaters gathered
around him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s coming up and the snow&rsquo;s starting
to drift. May be bad in another hour or two.
If you want to get home before midnight you&rsquo;d
better start now for it will be slow going up
in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start at once,&rdquo; decided Miss Bruder.
&ldquo;Get your wraps, everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet, some unknown fear tugging at her
heart, hung back and spoke to Mr. Youde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it perfectly safe to start the trip back?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. That&rsquo;s a powerful bus. But
you&rsquo;d better start now before the wind gets
bad. This snow is going to drift like fury
before morning. I expect we&rsquo;ll be blockaded
for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet rejoined the girls in the room where
they had left their coats. A horn sounded outside
and they hastened to don their wraps. The
floodlights in the yard flashed on and the group,
bidding the Youdes cheery goodnights, hastened
out to the bus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br /><i>Chapter IV</i>
<br />LITTLE DEER VALLEY</h2>
<p>In spite of her warm clothing, Janet could feel
the sting of the night air. It was much colder
than when they had arrived. The snow seemed
to be less, but the wind was shipping it in little
eddies across the yard.</p>
<p>With the heater running full blast, the bus
was comfortable and they found seats well up
toward the front. Miss Bruder counted them
to make sure that everyone was on hand. Reassured,
she told the driver to start the return
trip.</p>
<p>The windows were heavily frosted and it was
like being in a sealed room, the only peephole
being the small frame of glass which the windshield
wiper kept clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Janet asked Helen, who
had a wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine forty-five. We&rsquo;re starting home
early.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Janet nodded, but she was glad they had
made the start. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been pleasant
staying at Youde&rsquo;s if they had been snowed
in for the lonely inn had few comforts.</p>
<p>The powerful engine of the bus labored as
the big machine topped a grade out of the valley
and they swung down into another. For five
or six miles it would be one hill after another
and Janet wondered if the snow was drifting
down in the valleys.</p>
<p>The road was little used and if the wind increased,
it might make travel exceedingly difficult.
But she dismissed that thought from
her mind for the bus had heavy chains on the
double wheels at the rear.</p>
<p>The spontaneity which had marked their
trip out was missing and conversation soon
died away. Everyone was tired and willing to
snuggle down into their coats.</p>
<p>Janet must have been dozing for the heavy
roar of the bus motor awoke her with a start.</p>
<p>They were backing up. Then they stopped
and the driver shifted gears. The bus leaped
ahead, the throttle on full and the exhaust
barking in the crisp air. Gradually their forward
motion ceased and the wheels ground into
the snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Without a word the bus driver shifted instantly
into reverse and they lurched backward.
The driver stopped the bus, set the
emergency brake, and dodged out into the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Helen, who was
almost hidden in her fur coat and deliciously
sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve hit a drift,&rdquo; replied Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be almost home, though. It
seems like we&rsquo;ve been traveling for ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect we are,&rdquo; but Janet didn&rsquo;t feel the
optimism that she meant her words to convey.</p>
<p>If the wind had increased they might find
themselves in a serious situation.</p>
<p>The bus driver opened the door and stuck
his head in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of you fellows come out and give me
a hand with the shovels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Barron, nearest the door, responded with
Ed Rickey at his heels.</p>
<p>After several minutes the bus driver came
back inside and slowed the motor down to
idling speed and the wave of heat from the
heater diminished noticeably.</p>
<p>With the motor barely turning over, outside
noises were audible and Janet could hear
the rush of the wind. Particles of the fine,
dry snow were being driven against the window
beside her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>It was at least fifteen minutes later when
Jim, Ed and the driver returned, red-faced and
breathless from their exertions. The boys
dropped into the front seats while the driver
opened the throttle and sent the big machine
lumbering ahead.</p>
<p>The bus plunged into the drift, the chains
on the rear wheels biting deep into the snow.
Once they swung sharply and Janet gasped,
but they swung back and with the engine taxed
to the limit finally pulled through the drift.</p>
<p>Janet saw Jim look around and she thought
she detected grave concern in his eyes. Then
he turned away and she was too far away to
speak to him without alarming the others.</p>
<p>The bus labored up a long grade, breasted
the top of the hill, and then started down. It
would be in the valley that trouble would
come, for the snow would be heavily drifted.</p>
<p>The big machine rocked down the slope, jolting
its occupants around and bruising one or
two of them. Janet heard Miss Bruder cry
out sharply and turned around, but the teacher
motioned that she was all right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Then the speed of the bus slackened, the
wheels spun futilely, and their forward motion
ceased. Almost instantly they were in reverse,
but the bus slipped to one side and in spite of
the full power of the motor, the wheels churned
through the dry snow.</p>
<p>The driver eased up on the throttle, looked
significantly at Jim and Ed, and with them at
his heels plunged into the storm again. Fortunately,
he had tied several shovels to the
bus before leaving Youde&rsquo;s and they were not
without implements to dig themselves out.</p>
<p>Janet could hear them working, first at the
front and then at the rear and Helen, now
thoroughly wide awake, looked at her in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting colder in here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engine&rsquo;s barely turning over; there
isn&rsquo;t much heat coming out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but I mean the temperature outside
must be dropping rapidly, and listen to the
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Janet preferred not to listen to the wind;
it was too mournful, too nerve-wracking.
What it whispered alarmed her for they were
still some miles from the main road and there
were few if any farms near.</p>
<p>The bus driver returned and motioned to
the other boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a hand. We don&rsquo;t want to stay
here a minute longer than necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the boys piled out of the bus,
leaving the girls and Miss Bruder alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly frozen,&rdquo; complained Margie
Blake. &ldquo;At least we might have obtained a
good bus driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the driver&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; interposed
Janet. &ldquo;We stayed too long at Youde&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he should have told us the storm was
getting worse. My folks will be worried half
to death if we are hung up here all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet admitted to herself that they would
all have cause to worry if they had to stay in
the bus all night, for she doubted if the supply
of fuel would be sufficient to keep the engine
going to operate the heater for that length of
time and she dreaded to think of how cold it
might get if the heater was off.</p>
<p>Between the gusts of wind that swept
around the bus they could hear the steady swing
of the shovels biting into the snow. It was
eleven o&rsquo;clock when the driver came inside.
His face was almost white from the cold and
he beat his hands together as he took the wheel
and eased in the clutch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>With the motor roaring heavily Janet felt
the power being applied to the wheels ever so
gradually to keep them from slipping. The
bus seemed cemented into the snow, but
motion finally became evident. The wheels
churned and they moved backward.</p>
<p>Someone outside was shouting, but the words
were unintelligible to all except the driver.
He stopped while one of the boys scraped the
frost off the window outside for the windshield
wiper had frozen.</p>
<p>Then, barely creeping ahead and with the
bus in low gear, they moved through the snow,
shouted commands keeping the driver in the
right path. At last they were through the
drift and the boys piled back into the bus,
pounding each other on the back and clapping
their hands to bring back the circulation.</p>
<p>Miss Bruder called Jim Barron back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how serious is this, Jim?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad. We&rsquo;re three miles from the
main road and there isn&rsquo;t a farm within two
miles. Only thing we can do is to keep going
ahead and try to shovel through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Little Deer valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re worrying about. The
wind gets a clean sweep there and I&rsquo;m afraid
we may not get through.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can we turn back and stay at Youde&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the road behind us would be as
badly drifted as Little Deer valley,&rdquo; replied
Jim. &ldquo;I guess the only thing is to grind ahead
and trust that the gas holds out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they made steady progress, the
bus rumbling along smoothly and the heater
throwing out a steady blast of warm, dank air.
Then they rolled down a gentle slope and onto
the flat of Little Deer valley, which was more
than half a mile wide.</p>
<p>The driver stopped and went out to wade
through the drifts. He came back to report
that they might make it although in places the
drifts were nearly up to the tops of the fence
posts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to mean plenty of shoveling,&rdquo;
he warned them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go on,&rdquo; said Miss Bruder. &ldquo;If
we get stuck at least we&rsquo;re that much closer
to the road. Perhaps we could walk to the
main highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet saw Jim glance sharply at Miss Bruder.
Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t realize the seriousness of
their situation, or perhaps she was masking her
thoughts with those words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The gears ground again, the motor took up
its burden, and they lurched ahead, churning
through the deepening snow.</p>
<p>The air was colder now. There was no
warmth from the heater. Something had gone
wrong with the motor or a pipe had frozen.
No matter then. Getting through the drifts
was uppermost in their minds.</p>
<p>Gradually the straining progress of the bus
slowed, finally stopped, the gears clashed, and
they lurched backward several hundred feet.
Then they plunged ahead again, burrowing
deeper into the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody out to shovel,&rdquo; said the driver,
snapping off the engine to save fuel.</p>
<p>The boys hurried out into the cold and the
girls huddled closer to each other. Margie and
Cora, thinly clad for such a night, beat their
arms almost steadily and stamped their feet
in rhythmic cadence.</p>
<p>Janet and Helen, heavily clothed, were still
warm although the cold crept through their
gloves to some extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how cold it is?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea, but it feels like it was
almost zero. Let&rsquo;s not think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try not to think about it,&rdquo; retorted Helen,
and Janet admitted that her companion was
right. There was nothing to think about except
the cold and the snow. Of course there
was the class play, but marooned in the middle
of Little Deer valley with a howling
blizzard raging was no time to think of class
plays.</p>
<p>The driver came back and stepped on the
starter. The motor was slow in turning over.
It must be bitterly cold, thought Janet. Finally
the engine started and they plowed ahead a
few feet, then finally churned to a stop.</p>
<p>Outside the shovels clanged against the steel
sides of the bus as the boys dug into the snow
again. It was chilling, numbing work out
there and Jim Barron tumbled through the
door to stand up in front and beat his arms
steadily. When he went out, Ed Rickey came
in and the boys alternated.</p>
<p>Margie whimpered in the cold and Janet
felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My coat&rsquo;s large. I&rsquo;ll come up and sit with
you and Cora can come back here with Helen,&rdquo;
said Janet.</p>
<p>The other girls, thoroughly chilled, welcomed
the change and Janet unbuttoned the
voluminous coonskin and shared it with
Margie, Helen doing likewise for Cora. Janet
could feel Margie trembling as she pressed close
to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>After a time the driver returned and started
the motor again. They moved forward slowly,
creeping along the trail the boys had opened
with the shovels. Finally they rocked to a stop
and the driver turned toward Miss Bruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. The drifts are three feet high
and getting worse every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br /><i>Chapter V</i>
<br />THE WHITE MENACE</h2>
<p>Miss Bruder looked at the girls, huddled together
on the seats, desperately trying to keep
warm. Outside the boys were bravely attempting
to clear a path, but it was hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better get out and try to
reach the main road on foot,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t advise that,&rdquo; replied the driver.
&ldquo;Some of the girls couldn&rsquo;t make it through
the drifts. It must be well below zero now
and the snow&rsquo;s still coming down bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Jim and Ed led the boys back into
the bus, closing the door carefully after them.
They were covered with fine snow and frost
from their own breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try and break through to the
road,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;The rest of you stay here
and try to keep warm. Whatever you do,
don&rsquo;t leave the bus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone is going to try to make it to the
paved highway, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; spoke up the
driver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over this road a number
of times. I&rsquo;ll follow the fence line and get to
a farm somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the protests of the boys, the driver
remained firm, insisting that he, and he alone,
could make the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the door shut and don&rsquo;t run the
motor. The heater&rsquo;s out of order now and if
you run the motor, carbon monoxide fumes
may creep in. They&rsquo;re deadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that was an unnecessary warning for all
of the boys knew the danger of the motor
fumes in a closed compartment.</p>
<p>Bundling himself up well, the driver
plunged into the storm and Miss Bruder and
her honors English class were left alone in the
middle of Little Deer valley with the worst
storm of the winter raging around their
marooned bus.</p>
<p>Jim turned off the headlights, leaving only
the red and green warning lights atop the bus
on. He snapped the switches for the interior
lights until only one was left aglow for there
was no use to waste the precious supply of
electricity in the storage battery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>If anything the whine of the wind was
louder and it was exceedingly lonely out there
despite the presence of the others. There was
something about it that made Janet feel as
though she were a hundred miles from civilization.
She had not dreamed it would be possible
to have such a sense of loneliness and yet
be in a group of schoolmates.</p>
<p>Jim Barron and Ed Rickey kept on the move,
talking with some of the boys or attempting
to cheer up the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get up every few minutes and swing
your arms and stamp your feet,&rdquo; advised Ed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll keep the circulation going; otherwise
you may suffer frostbite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen squinted her eyes and looked at her
watch in the dim light shed by the single bulb.
It was just after midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we&rsquo;ll be home by morning,&rdquo; she
asked, turning back to Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so, though I&rsquo;m not in the least
bit hungry after the big meal we had at
Youde&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems ages away,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
almost forgotten the skating party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margie, who had taken shelter under Janet&rsquo;s
coat, spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the bus driver&rsquo;s fault. We never
should have left Youde&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But none of us wanted to spend the night
there,&rdquo; said Janet. &ldquo;Of course we didn&rsquo;t dream
the snow would have drifted this much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The driver should have known,&rdquo; insisted
Margie, and Janet thought her more than a
little unreasonable, but then Margie was probably
thoroughly chilled and likely to disagree
with everything and everyone.</p>
<p>The minutes passed slowly, dragging as
Janet had never known they could. The cold
increased in intensity and some of the other
girls, not as warmly dressed as Janet and Helen,
began to complain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet are getting numb,&rdquo; said Bernice
Grogan, a slip of a little black-haired Irish girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep them moving,&rdquo; said Ed Rickey.
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll move them for you until the circulation
starts back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ed knelt down on the floor and took
Bernice&rsquo;s boots in his hands, massaging her feet
vigorously.</p>
<p>Soon Bernice began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pain. They hurt terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the circulation coming back,&rdquo; said Ed,
but Janet knew from the lines on his forehead
that Ed was worried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If any of the rest of you feel numb, just
call out. We&rsquo;ve got to keep moving or some of
us may suffer some frozen parts before morning,&rdquo;
he warned.</p>
<p>Bernice, in spite of her efforts, couldn&rsquo;t keep
the tears back, but they froze on her cheeks,
so bitter was the cold.</p>
<p>Jim Barron opened the door, and a rush of
cutting air swept in. Then he was gone into
the night and Janet could hear him wielding
the shovel outside.</p>
<p>It was five or six minutes before Jim returned
and he looked utterly exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such a night,&rdquo; he mumbled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the bus driver didn&rsquo;t get
very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better start out after him,&rdquo; said
Ed, getting to his feet.</p>
<p>But Jim&rsquo;s broad shoulders barred the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to stay right here. You can&rsquo;t
even find the fences now. It would be suicide
to start in the dark. The only thing we can
do is keep as warm as possible inside the bus. I
started throwing snow up around the windows.
Some of you fellows give me a hand. We&rsquo;ll
bank the bus in snow clear to the top and that
will keep out some of this bitter wind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if you cover the bus with snow, they&rsquo;ll
never find us when they come hunting us,&rdquo;
protested Cora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just never mind about that,&rdquo; retorted Jim.
&ldquo;The only thing I&rsquo;m worrying about now is
keeping us from freezing to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s words shocked the girls into silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br /><i>Chapter VI</i>
<br />DESPERATE HOURS</h2>
<p>Freezing to death! The phrase was terrible
in its import, yet the danger was very near
and very deadly, for there was slight chance
that the bus driver had gotten through to give
a warning of their predicament. Even if he
had Janet wondered if any searching party
could brave the rigors of the night.</p>
<p>Outside the boys worked steadily, coming
inside in shifts, and then going back. They
could hear the snow thud against the side of
the bus as it was piled higher and higher and
the sound of the wind gradually faded as the
wall of snow protecting them from it
thickened.</p>
<p>The light from the single bulb was ghostly
now. The battery seemed to be weakening.
Helen looked at her watch. It was just one
o&rsquo;clock when the boys came in, beating their
hands and knocking the frost from their breath
off their coats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Jim was the last one in and he closed the door
carefully after him.</p>
<p>Bernice was crying again and Ed, though
half frozen himself, bent down and massaged
her feet. Miss Bruder was white and shaken
for it was more than she could cope with and
she turned to Ed and Jim to pull them through
the emergency.</p>
<p>While Ed worked with Bernice&rsquo;s feet, Jim
spoke to the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well face this thing frankly,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in an awful jam. It must
be fifteen or twenty below right now. The
snow has stopped, but the wind is increasing
in strength and the snow is drifting badly. It
may be hours, perhaps a day, before we&rsquo;re discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and watched the conflicting emotions
on their faces, then plunged on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve banked the bus with snow to keep
out the worst of the wind, but it&rsquo;s going to be
terribly cold just the same. We&rsquo;ve got to keep
moving, keep up our spirits. If we don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim didn&rsquo;t finish his sentence. There
was no need for they all knew what would
happen once they became groggy and sleepy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start with a count and I want
all of you to beat your feet in time with me.
That&rsquo;ll jar your whole body and warm you
up a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim started counting and soon the whole
group was stamping their feet methodically.</p>
<p>Even Janet had not realized how cold she
was. Her feet had felt a little numb, but
under the steady pounding against the floor
they started to tingle, then burn with an intensity
that brought tears to her eyes where
they froze on her lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly frozen,&rdquo; chattered Margie, huddling
closer to Janet. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for your
coat I&rsquo;d be like an icicle by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kept up the motion with their feet
for at least five minutes, and Jim called a halt
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone feel a little warmer?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hands are still cold,&rdquo; said one of the
girls, but Janet was too stiff to turn around and
see who was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s an arm drill for everyone,&rdquo; said
Jim, starting to swing his arms in cadence.</p>
<p>When that exercise was completed, most of
them could feel their bodies aglow as the blood
raced through their veins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Ed started to tell funny stories and though
he did his best, their own situation was so tragic
that nothing appeared humorous. But he kept
them interested, which was the main thing.</p>
<p>Helen was the first to break the now
monotonous flow of Ed&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Ed,&rdquo; she said, her voice low and tense.
&ldquo;Shake Miss Bruder, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ed turned suddenly to the teacher, who had
been sitting back of him. Her head had fallen
forward on her chest and her arms hung limp.</p>
<p>The husky senior picked her up and brought
her back under the light, the rest crowding
around him.</p>
<p>Then Janet took charge. Miss Bruder&rsquo;s eyes
were closed, but she was breathing slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe she&rsquo;s half frozen. She was sitting
where a constant knife of air was coming in
around the door,&rdquo; whispered Jim. &ldquo;Get busy
and massage her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet, with Helen helping her, stripped off
Miss Bruder&rsquo;s thin gloves. Her hands were
pitifully white.</p>
<p>Ed scooped up a handful of snow where it
had sifted in around the door and used it to
rub Miss Bruder&rsquo;s hands while Janet and Helen
massaged the upper part of her body and her
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>It was five minutes before the teacher responded
to their frantic efforts. Then her eyes
opened and she tried to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have dozed for a moment,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Rest now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everyone all right?&rdquo; insisted the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; replied Jim, who was
keeping a close eye on Bernice, who seemed the
most susceptible to the cold.</p>
<p>Ed pulled Janet to the rear of the bus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing is getting serious,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Some of the girls won&rsquo;t be able to stand it
until morning unless we&rsquo;re able to keep them
warmer. Jim and I have sheepskins. We&rsquo;ll
put them down on the floor and you girls get
down and lie on them. Huddle together and
cover up with your own coats. Your body
heat should keep you warm and we&rsquo;ll be moving
around and talking to you so none of you
will get too drowsy from the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that. You and Jim will
freeze,&rdquo; protested Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freeze? I guess not. We&rsquo;re too tough for
that. Besides, I&rsquo;ve got all kinds of clothes on
under this sheepskin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Janet finally agreed to the plan and Ed explained
it briefly. Miss Bruder hesitated, but
the others overruled her.</p>
<p>Jim and Ed placed their heavy canvas, sheep-lined
coats on the floor and the girls laid down
on them like ten pins, huddling together and
putting their own coats over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get just as close as you can so you&rsquo;ll keep
each other warm,&rdquo; counseled Jim, who, minus
his heavy coat, was busy swinging his arms
and legs.</p>
<p>In less than five minutes the girls were ready
to admit that the plan was an excellent one, for
they were quite comfortable under the mound
of coats and Janet made them keep up a constant
flow of conversation, calling to each girl
every few minutes. Up in the front of the
bus they could hear the boys moving steadily
and stamping their feet.</p>
<p>How long they had been under the pile of
coats Janet couldn&rsquo;t guess, but suddenly there
was a wild pounding on the door of the bus.
She managed to get her head out from
under the coats in time to see Jim open the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone safe?&rdquo; cried someone outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; replied Jim and then Janet
saw her father looking down at the huddled
group of girls on the floor of the bus. His
face was covered with frost, but he brushed
past the boys and knelt beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, honey?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little cold,&rdquo; Janet managed to smile.
&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. The first thing is to
get out of here and where you&rsquo;ll be safe and
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other men poured into the bus. Janet
recognized some of them. Ed&rsquo;s father was
there. So was Jim&rsquo;s, Cora&rsquo;s and Margie&rsquo;s.
Someone had a big bottle of hot coffee and
cardboard cups. The steaming hot liquid,
bitter without sugar or cream, was passed
around.</p>
<p>Janet drank her cup eagerly and the hot
beverage warmed her chilled body.</p>
<p>Extra coats and mufflers had been brought
by the rescue party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get as warm as you can. It&rsquo;s going to be
a cold ride to the paved road,&rdquo; advised her
father.</p>
<p>They were soon ready and once more the
door of the bus was opened. Outside a powerful
searchlight glowed and as they neared it
Janet saw a large caterpillar tractor. Behind
this was a hayrack, mounted on runners and
well filled with hay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody into the rack. Burrow down
deep so you&rsquo;ll keep warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s father counted them as they got into
the rack, yelled to the operator of the tractor
to start, and then piled into the rack himself.</p>
<p>With a series of sharp reports from its exhaust,
the lumbering tractor got into motion,
jerking the rack and its precious load behind it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br /><i>Chapter VII</i>
<br />SANCTUARY AT HOME</h2>
<p>It was nearly an hour later when the tractor
breasted the last grade and rolled down to the
paved road where a dozen cars, all of them
warmly heated and well lighted, were strung
along the road. Anxious fathers and mothers
were on hand, including Janet&rsquo;s mother and
Mrs. Thorne and they welcomed their thoroughly
chilled daughters to their bosoms.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s father shepherded them into their own
sedan where despite the sub-zero cold the
heater had kept the car comfortable. Then
they started the final lap of their eventful trip
from Youde&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Helen and Janet sank back on the cushions
of the capacious rear seat, thoroughly worn out
by their trying experience.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s father, one of the most prominent
attorneys in Clarion, slipped in behind the
wheel, slamming the car door and shutting out
the biting blast of air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>There were other cars ahead of them and
they made no attempt at high speed as they
rolled back into the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever find us, Dad?&rdquo; asked
Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can thank the bus driver for that.
Somehow he got through to a farmhouse. He
was almost frozen, but he managed to tell them
the story and they phoned word in to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who thought of the tractor and hayrack?&rdquo;
asked Helen, warm once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Hugh Grogan, Bernice&rsquo;s father. He
sells the caterpillars. Good thing he did or
we&rsquo;d never have gotten through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good thing for Bernice, too. She
was about all in,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>When they reached the Hardy home, Janet&rsquo;s
mother insisted that Helen and Mrs. Thorne
come in and have a hot lunch before going to
their own home.</p>
<p>While the girls took off their coats and Mr.
Hardy put the car into the garage, Mrs. Hardy
bustled out into the kitchen where she had left
a kettle of water simmering on the stove.</p>
<p>Lunch was ready in short order, tea, peanut
butter sandwiches, cookies and a large bowl of
fruit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Janet and Helen had ravenous appetites and
the sandwiches disappeared as though by
magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cold is it, Dad?&rdquo; asked Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-two below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind was awful,&rdquo; said Helen, between
bites at a sandwich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. It was pretty fierce going across
country in the hayrack. The boys must have
used their heads for someone banked the bus
with snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Jim Barron&rsquo;s idea. He and Ed
Rickey kept us moving and talking most of
the time, but we forgot Miss Bruder. She was
in a draft and almost froze to death without
saying a word to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scared us half to death,&rdquo; put in Helen,
&ldquo;but the boys massaged her hands with snow
and Janet and I massaged the upper part of
her body until we could get the circulation
going again. I think she&rsquo;ll be all right, but
probably pretty sensitive to cold for the rest
of the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the winter&rsquo;s almost over. Here it&rsquo;s
late March. Who&rsquo;d ever have thought we&rsquo;d
have a storm like this,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I had, I can assure you that you&rsquo;d never
have made the trip to Youde&rsquo;s tonight,&rdquo; promised
her father. &ldquo;It was one of those freak
storms that sometimes sweep down from the
Arctic circle and fool even the weather men.
By tomorrow the temperature will shoot up
and the snow will melt so fast we&rsquo;ll probably
have a flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls finished every sandwich on the
plate and drank two cups of tea apiece.</p>
<p>It was five o&rsquo;clock when they left the table.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thorne and Helen started to put on
their coats, but Janet&rsquo;s mother objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your house will be cold and our guest room
upstairs is all made up. Janet and I will lend
you whatever you need. We&rsquo;ll all get to bed
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet got warm pajamas for Helen and then
went to her own room. Warm and inviting
in the soft rays of the rose-shaded lamp over
her dressing table, it was a sanctuary after the
exciting events of the night.</p>
<p>A wave of drowsiness assailed Janet, and it
was with difficulty that she unlaced and pulled
off her boots. Somehow she managed to crawl
into her pajamas and roll into bed, but she was
asleep before she could remember to turn off
the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Her mother, looking in a few minutes later,
pulled the blankets up around Janet&rsquo;s
shoulders, opened the window just a crack to
let in a whiff of fresh air, and turned off the
light.</p>
<p>Janet slept a heavy and dreamless sleep.
When she awakened the sun was streaming in
the windows and from the angle she could tell
that it was late.</p>
<p>But in spite of the knowledge that she would
probably be extremely late in getting to school,
Janet was too deliciously comfortable to move
rapidly.</p>
<p>After stretching leisurely, she got out of bed
and closed the window. The radiator in her
room was bubbling gently and she slipped into
bed to wait until the room warmed up.</p>
<p>Vivid thoughts of what had happened during
the night rotated in her mind, the cold, the
wind, the snow&mdash;the terror of waiting in Little
Deer valley for the rescue, hoping but
not knowing for sure that they would be
reached in time to save them from the relentless
cold.</p>
<p>Someone opened Janet&rsquo;s door and peered in.
It was Helen, who, on seeing that her friend
was awake, bounced into the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You look pretty live and wide awake after
last night,&rdquo; smiled Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not only that, I&rsquo;m ravenously hungry,&rdquo;
said Helen, &ldquo;and if you had been out in the
hall and caught a whiff of the breakfast your
mother is preparing you would be too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can call it breakfast or lunch,
depending on whether you&rsquo;ve had breakfast.
For me it&rsquo;s breakfast even though the clock
says it&rsquo;s just a little after eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re seeing things,&rdquo; retorted Janet,
throwing off the covers and hurrying toward
her wardrobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I am, but your
mother says it is after eleven and I&rsquo;ll take her
word for it. I&rsquo;ll run down and tell her you&rsquo;ll
be along within the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t fair. You know it won&rsquo;t be
more than five minutes. I always dress faster
than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br /><i>Chapter VIII</i>
<br />POSTPONED TRYOUTS</h2>
<p>Helen went down stairs and Janet hastened
to the bathroom where she made a hasty toilet.
Back in her room she fairly jumped into her
clothes, gave her hair one final and hurried
caress with the brush, and then went down
stairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thorne, who had breakfasted earlier
with Janet&rsquo;s father and mother, had gone
home, so Helen and Janet sat down to the
breakfast Mrs. Hardy had prepared.</p>
<p>There was grapefruit to start with, then oatmeal
with dates in it, hot, well-buttered toast,
strips of crisp bacon and large glasses of milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel all right this morning, Janet?&rdquo; her
mother asked, looking a little anxiously at her
vibrant and energetic daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, mother. I slept very soundly. Last
night seems almost like a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a nightmare,&rdquo; said her mother, sitting
down and picking up a piece of toast to
munch while the girls ate their breakfast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never seen your father so worried. He was
almost frantic until Hugh Grogan suggested
they try to get through with one of his big
tractors. They held a council of war right
here in the front room and I&rsquo;ve never seen as
many nervous and excited men in my life. Talk
about women getting upset, why they were
worse than we ever think of being.&rdquo; She
smiled a little. She could now, but last night
it had all been a very grim and very near
tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to write an excuse for me,&rdquo;
said Janet between munches on a crisp slice of
bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time. I phoned the superintendent
and he said that everyone in honors English
was excused from school today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we&rsquo;ll have the tryouts for the
class play this afternoon?&rdquo; said Helen, who
until that moment had been devoting her full
energies to the large bowl of oatmeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one way of finding out,&rdquo; replied
Janet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll phone the principal&rsquo;s office
and see if it has been taken off the bulletin
board.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Janet went to the phone in the hall and called
the schoolhouse. When she returned her face
was aglow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No school, no tryouts&mdash;what a day and
what to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure about the tryouts?&rdquo; Helen was
insistent, for winning the leading part meant
so much to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure as sure can be. They&rsquo;ve been postponed
until Saturday morning at 9:30 o&rsquo;clock
when they will be held in the assembly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that will give me plenty of time to
study my part thoroughly,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know it now. Why you had it
memorized, every word and phrase, yesterday
afternoon,&rdquo; protested Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did yesterday, but last night
scared it completely out of me. I can&rsquo;t even
remember the opening lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing. We&rsquo;ll both start
over and this afternoon we can rehearse upstairs
in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand. I&rsquo;ve got to go home and help
mother for a while, but I&rsquo;ll be back by 2:30
o&rsquo;clock and we&rsquo;ll start in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Breakfast over, Janet went to the door with
Helen. The day was bright and almost unbelievably
clear. The temperature was rising
rapidly, the wind had gone down, and their
experience of the night before seemed very far
away. Rivulets of water were starting to run
down the streets and before nightfall the
gutters would be full of the melting snow and
slush.</p>
<p>Janet found a multitude of little things to
do around home to help her mother and the
first interruption came with the ringing of the
telephone. Her mother answered, but then
summoned Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Times,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardy.</p>
<p>Janet took the instrument and recognized
the voice of the city editor of the local
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need a good first person story of what took
place inside the bus, Janet,&rdquo; said Pete Benda.
&ldquo;Can you come down to the office and write a
yarn? You&rsquo;ve had enough experience with
your high school page to do the trick and do
it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it all seems so far away and kind of
vague now,&rdquo; protested Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Janet, I&rsquo;ve got to have that story.&rdquo;
Pete was cajoling now. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we done a
lot of favors for your high school page?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then come down and write the story. I&rsquo;ll
save a good spot on page one for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet hung up the telephone, feeling a little
weak and limp. Pete Benda was insistent and
she would have to go through with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Times wants me to come down and
write a first person story of what happened
last night,&rdquo; she explained to her mother. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t want to, but Pete Benda, the city editor,
just insisted. He&rsquo;s been so good about helping
us out on the school page when we&rsquo;ve been in
jams that I couldn&rsquo;t say no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, and you&rsquo;ll do a good piece
of writing. No don&rsquo;t worry about it. Run
along. I&rsquo;ll have a little lunch ready when you
get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet put on her coat, but paused at the door
and called to her mother. &ldquo;If Helen comes
before I get back, tell her I&rsquo;ll be along soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet enjoyed the walk to the Times office
for the air was invigorating.</p>
<p>The Times was housed in a narrow two-story
building with its press in the basement. The
news department was on the second floor with
the city editor&rsquo;s desk in front of a large window
where he could look the full length of the main
business street of Clarion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Pete Benda, thin and too white-faced for his
own good health, saw Janet come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a desk and typewriter you can use,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on having that story
in less than an hour. You&rsquo;ll have to come
through, young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet flushed at Pete&rsquo;s appellation, for the
city editor of the Times was only a little older
than she. Oh well, perhaps Pete was twenty-two,
but she could remember when he had
been in high school, playing football, and one
of the best ends in the state.</p>
<p>Janet rolled some copy paper into the typewriter
and looked rather blankly at the sheet.
It was hard now to concentrate on the events
which had been so tragically real the night before.
If she could only get the first sentence
to click the rest would come easily. She tried
one phrase. That wouldn&rsquo;t do; not enough
action in it. Ripping the sheet of paper from
the typewriter, she inserted another and tried
again. This was better. Perhaps it would do;
at least she had started, and the words came
now in a smooth flow for Janet could type
rapidly, thanks to a commercial course in her
junior year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Pete Benda, on his way to the composing
room, looked over her shoulder and read the
first paragraph but Janet, now engrossed in
the story, hardly noticed him. Pursing his lips
in a low whistle, a trick that he did when
pleased, Pete went on about his work.</p>
<p>Janet finished one page and then another.
Even a third materialized under the steady tapping
of her fingers on the keyboard. Then she
was through. Three pages of copy, three pages
of short, sharp sentences, of adjectives that
caught and held the imagination, that gave
a picture of the cold and the apprehension of
those in the bus, of the relief, almost hysterical,
when rescue came.</p>
<p>Janet didn&rsquo;t read it over. It was the best
she could do. If Pete wanted to change it that
was all right with her. She put the three sheets
of copy paper together and placed them on his
desk. Then she slipped into her coat and went
down stairs. She had finished the story well
within the limit set by the city editor and she
turned toward home and the rehearsal she and
Helen had planned for the afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br /><i>Chapter IX</i>
<br />BIG NEWS</h2>
<p>Janet had gone less than half a block when
she heard someone calling to her. Looking back
she saw Pete Benda leaning from an upper
window of the Times office. He was waving
Janet&rsquo;s story in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great story, Janet,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send
you a box of candy. Thanks a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet smiled and waved at Pete. It was just
like the impetuous city editor to lean out his
window and shout his thoughts at the top of
his voice to someone down the street. But she
was glad to know that the story met Pete&rsquo;s approval.
But as for the candy. Well Pete was
always making promises like that. If he had
kept them all he would have needed a private
candy factory.</p>
<p>Helen was waiting when Janet reached home
and she waved a letter at her friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Dad,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s
about through on the picture he&rsquo;s making at
present and will be home without fail for my
graduation. Wants me to send him the dates
of the play, of the banquet and of everything.
Also wants your Dad to make sure the fishing
will be good and to line up a good plot where
he can find plenty of worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid news. I&rsquo;m so happy,&rdquo; said
Janet, who knew how much Helen missed her
father&rsquo;s companionship at times, for when he
was in Clarion they were almost inseparable.
But Janet realized that Mr. Thorne was exceedingly
smart in keeping Helen in Clarion
rather than taking her west with him to the
movie city where she would be subject to all of
the tensions and nervous activity there. Here
in Clarion she was growing up in entirely
normal surroundings where she would have a
sane and sensible outlook on life and its values.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I phoned your Dad, and he says he&rsquo;ll have
to start hunting good creeks just as soon as the
snow&rsquo;s off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That kind of puts Dad on the spot, for he&rsquo;s
got to deliver on the worms and the fishing,&rdquo;
smiled Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, Dad doesn&rsquo;t care so much about
getting any fish. He just likes to get out and
loaf on a sunny creek bank and either talk
with your Dad or doze. He calls that a real
holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Janet went upstairs and got the mimeographed
sheets with the synopsis of the play
and the part she was to try out for. After the
drama of last night, that of &ldquo;The Chinese
Image&rdquo; seemed shallow and forced.</p>
<p>The r&ocirc;le of Abbie Naughton, who was more
than a little light-headed and fun loving until
a crisis came along, was comparatively easy for
it called for little actual acting ability and
Janet was frank enough to admit that she was
no actress.</p>
<p>Helen, trying for the straight lead, carried
by Gale Naughton, had always liked to think
that she had real dramatic talent and Janet was
willing to admit that her companion had more
than average ability. At least Helen was pretty
enough to carry the r&ocirc;le off whether she had
any dramatic ability or not.</p>
<p>Coaching each other, they gave their own
interpretations of the parts which they
were trying for. An hour and then another
slipped away. The brightness faded from the
afternoon and Janet turned on a reading
light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve done all we can for one day.
If we keep on we&rsquo;ll go stale. Let&rsquo;s forget the
tryouts for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; retorted Helen, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve simply
got to win that part. What would Dad think
of me if I didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d think any the less of
you,&rdquo; smiled Janet, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll admit it would
be nice for you to win the leading r&ocirc;le and I&rsquo;ll
do everything I can to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know you will. It was awfully
small of me to say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doorbell rang and Janet answered it. A
boy handed her a package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Miss Hardy. She live here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Janet Hardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I just wanted to be sure this was
the right place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks interesting,&rdquo; said Janet, returning
to the living room with the large box. Her
mother, who had heard the doorbell, joined
them.</p>
<p>Janet tore off the wrapping, opened the
cardboard outer box, and pulled out a two
pound box of assorted chocolates. On top of
the box was a clipping torn from the front
page of the Times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Janet stared hard at the clipping, hardly
believing her eyes. There was her story with
her name signed to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Janet, your name is on this front page
story!&rdquo; exclaimed her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the mystery?&rdquo; demanded Helen,
and Janet explained, rather quickly, about her
summons to the Times office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete Benda said he liked the story and was
going to send me a box of candy, but I thought
he was joking. You know he&rsquo;s always telling
people he&rsquo;s going to send them candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no joke,&rdquo; said Helen as Janet opened
the box and offered candy to her mother and
to Helen. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;d like a joke like this
about once a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I wouldn&rsquo;t like an experience like
we had once a week,&rdquo; retorted Janet.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s mother phoned that they were having
an early supper and Helen picked up the
tryout sheets, put her coat over her shoulders,
and started for home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I disappear, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve been swept
away in the flood,&rdquo; she called as she hurried out.</p>
<p>Janet looked after her. Helen wasn&rsquo;t far
from wrong. With the rapidly rising temperature,
the afternoon sun had covered the sidewalks
and filled the street with rushing torrents
of water. Another day and there would be
no sign of the storm of the night before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Mrs. Hardy called and Janet went into the
kitchen to help her mother with the preparations
for the evening meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you rehearsing this afternoon,&rdquo;
said her mother, &ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t set my heart
too much on winning one of those parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; promised Janet. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;d
like to be in the senior play, but I won&rsquo;t be
heart-broken if I don&rsquo;t win a part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I was thinking more about Helen
than you,&rdquo; confessed Mrs. Hardy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so
much in earnest that failure would upset her
greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I can understand why Helen
wants a part and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;d be just as intent
if my father were the ace director for a great
motion picture company. I suppose I&rsquo;d think
that I should have dramatic ability to be a success
in his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardy. &ldquo;Helen
doesn&rsquo;t need to get a part in the play. When
he comes home, he likes nothing better than
being with his wife and Helen. You know
he never goes any place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except fishing with Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw. They don&rsquo;t fish. They dig
a few worms and take their old fishpoles along
some creek that never did have any fish. It
just gets them outdoors and away from people
who might want to bother Henry Thorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no matter, Helen has set her heart
on winning the leading r&ocirc;le and I&rsquo;m going to
do everything in my power to help her along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br /><i>Chapter X</i>
<br />VICTORY FOR HELEN</h2>
<p>The rest of the week slipped away quickly.
The harrowing experience in Little Deer valley
became a memory and the seniors concentrated
upon winning r&ocirc;les in the class play.</p>
<p>By Saturday morning the snow had vanished,
the temperature was above freezing and the
grass was starting to turn green&mdash;such are the
miracles of the early spring.</p>
<p>Janet and Helen rehearsed their tryout parts
so many times that Janet found herself
mumbling her lines in her sleep.</p>
<p>Most of the seniors assembled promptly at
9:30 o&rsquo;clock that morning for the tryouts. A
few of them, feeling that they had no chance,
did not come, but Janet noticed that Margie
and Cora were well to the front of the room
where Miss Williams would be sure to see
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to do your best this morning
for on your work now depends whether you
will have a place in the play,&rdquo; she warned them,
and Janet felt a little twinge. School was near
an end and the senior play was her last chance.
Of course it wasn&rsquo;t as important to her as it
was to Helen, but it would be nice to have the
part of Abbie, for Abbie was such a delightfully
irresponsible character.</p>
<p>Miss Williams called for tryouts for
minor r&ocirc;les first and Helen sent an anxious
glance toward Janet and nodded toward the
hall.</p>
<p>They slipped out of the assembly quietly and
Helen voiced her fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better try for one of these minor
parts as well as for the lead. Then if I don&rsquo;t
get to play Gale Naughton, I may win another
r&ocirc;le.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; counseled Janet. &ldquo;Concentrate
on the main part. I think you&rsquo;ll make
it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had your confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not confident about winning a part
myself, but I&rsquo;m sure you will,&rdquo; replied Janet.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back and watch the tryouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought to go over my lines again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. You can even speak them backwards.
If you work on them any more you
may do that, which would be fatal. Let&rsquo;s see
the mistakes of the others and then we&rsquo;ll know
we aren&rsquo;t the world&rsquo;s worst actresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams was conscientious. She
wanted every boy and girl who felt he had a
chance to have the utmost opportunity and she
worked with them carefully. At noon she was
fairly well down the cast, but the four major
r&ocirc;les remained, two for the boys and two
for the girls, including the parts of Gale and
Abbie Naughton which Helen and Janet
sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been at this long enough,&rdquo; announced
Miss Williams as the noon whistles
sounded down town. &ldquo;Everyone take a rest,
have lunch, and be back here at one o&rsquo;clock.
Then we&rsquo;ll go on until we finish. For those
who have been assigned parts, the first rehearsal
will be Monday night at 7:15 o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ll expect
you to have your first act lines
memorized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group broke up, some of them going
home to have lunch and others stopping at the
luncheonette of a nearby drug store. Janet
and Helen were among this group, which included
Cora and Margie. The latter, seated
with two companions, appeared confident that
they would win the leading r&ocirc;les, but Janet
overheard a spiteful remark by Cora.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I haven&rsquo;t the pull Helen has, for
her father&rsquo;s a famous director,&rdquo; she said, and
Janet saw Helen&rsquo;s face flush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;You know
Dad wouldn&rsquo;t use any influence to get a part
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So does Cora. She&rsquo;s saying that just to be
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reassembled it was a small group,
Jim Barron, Ed Rickey and two other
boys who were trying for the male leads,
Cora, Margie, Helen, Janet and Miss Williams.</p>
<p>The instructor worked with the boys first
and it was evident that Jim and Ed were to
have the major parts. In less than half an hour
they were assigned, Ed getting the lead and
Jim the second r&ocirc;le. If Janet won the part of
Abbie, Jim would be playing opposite her.
That would be fun, for Jim was wholesome and
pleasant.</p>
<p>After the boys had departed, Miss Williams
turned to the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re down to the two major parts,
for the play hinges on the characters of Gale
and Abbie.&rdquo; She looked at the four hopeful,
anxious faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Cora and Margie first. Take your
places and give me an interpretation of the
action you think should go with the lines you
have memorized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora, dark-eyed and confident, stepped to
the platform. Margie, a wispy, blonde girl,
followed. Both girls used excellent diction,
spoke clearly and with feeling, but somehow
Cora&rsquo;s work lacked a convincing touch. Perhaps
she was trying too hard and Janet felt her
spirits rising.</p>
<p>Helen should walk away with the r&ocirc;le unless
she got scared when she stepped on the platform.
But Janet was more than a little concerned
about Margie. The blonde senior was
doing an excellent job, putting just the right
amount of enthusiasm into the r&ocirc;le. There
was nothing forced. Every word and gesture
seemed spontaneous and lines that had sounded
silly in their own rehearsals were very logical
and convincing when they came tumbling
from Margie&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>Janet smiled grimly. Of course she wanted
the part, but even more, she wanted Helen to
win the r&ocirc;le of Gale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Cora and Margie finished the part Miss Williams
had assigned, and looked anxiously toward
the dramatics teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very nicely done,&rdquo; said Miss
Williams. &ldquo;Janet and Helen next and put
plenty of feeling into your interpretations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the platform Janet could look down
on Cora and Margie. There was a thin sneer
on Cora&rsquo;s lips and Janet felt Helen, standing
close beside her, tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; she asked. Helen nodded.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s lines opened their brief tryout r&ocirc;les.
She spoke them clearly, but somehow the spark
needed to add vigor and brilliance was lacking.
She was thinking too much about Helen.</p>
<p>The lines and action snapped to Helen and
she picked them up instantly. Janet thrilled.
Helen had forgotten Cora and Margie. She
had forgotten even Miss Williams. She was
living her part. She was Gale Naughton,
the dark, lovely heroine of &ldquo;The Chinese Image.&rdquo;
The lines came smoothly and without
effort.</p>
<p>Then they were through, a little breathless,
their hearts beating rapidly. Janet was the
first to turn toward Miss Williams and before
the instructor spoke, she knew Helen had made
a deep impression with her interpretation of
Gale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid. I liked that very much,&rdquo; said
Miss Williams, who was not given to compliments.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be good enough to wait a
few minutes, I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you announce the winners then?&rdquo;
asked Cora, her dark cheeks flushed with excitement
and her brown eyes glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; promised Miss Williams, hurrying
from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose she left to make her
tabulations?&rdquo; asked Helen, her voice low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably didn&rsquo;t want us to know just how
she rated us. She&rsquo;s got a percentage system all
her own she uses in casting parts. It won&rsquo;t be
long now,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better. I&rsquo;m all fluttery inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you think Cora and Margie aren&rsquo;t.
They can&rsquo;t even sit still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was true. Cora and Margie were
walking restlessly up and down the far side of
the assembly, looking anxiously toward the
double doorway through which Miss Williams
would return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Five minutes slipped away. Then another
five and it stretched out into fifteen minutes
before the quick footsteps of the dramatics
instructor could be heard in the hallway. Involuntarily
Cora and Margie joined Janet and
Helen at the front of the large assembly room.</p>
<p>Miss Williams came in briskly, a slip of
paper in her right hand, and Janet, who was
nearest, saw two names written on the slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I kept you so long, but I&rsquo;m trying to
be very fair in making the final selections,&rdquo;
explained Miss Williams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, go on,&rdquo; burst out Cora. &ldquo;Who
won?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry, Cora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark-haired senior interrupted her
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I didn&rsquo;t win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that Helen gave a more convincing
interpretation of the part. She gets the leading
r&ocirc;le.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora&rsquo;s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known that. Too bad I don&rsquo;t
have a father with some influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora picked up her coat. &ldquo;Come on, Margie.
We&rsquo;ve just wasted our time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stay if I were you, Margie,&rdquo; said Miss
Williams. &ldquo;What I have to say should interest
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in those words Janet knew the decision.
Helen had the lead and Margie was to get the
second r&ocirc;le. She was out, but at least she could
take it without creating a scene like Cora.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br /><i>Chapter XI</i>
<br />A FAMOUS DIRECTOR ARRIVES</h2>
<p>Miss Williams looked at the three girls remaining
and she spoke slowly, choosing her
words with care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret that Cora took that attitude,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;for there was no influence used in my
selection of Helen for the lead. She was much
better in the tryout than Cora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the instructor turned to Margie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did a nice bit as Abbie,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;and I want you to take that r&ocirc;le. Janet was
practically as good as you were on the lines, but
you seem a little more like the character.
You&rsquo;re thinner and you flutter around more
than Janet, and Abbie is a very fluttery sort of
a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margie grinned. &ldquo;In other words, Abbie is
a dizzy sort of a gal and I&rsquo;m that type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it that if you want to,&rdquo; smiled Miss
Williams. &ldquo;Do you want the part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will expect you and Helen
to have your lines for the first act well in hand
by Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Williams, followed by Margie, left the
room and Helen turned to face Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it turned out this way. I&rsquo;d
rather you had won a part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Janet, and she said it
honestly, for a part in the senior play had meant
so much more to Helen. She knew she had
done her best, but she had to admit that after
all Margie was better suited to the r&ocirc;le than
she.</p>
<p>The air softened. April came and went, and
the senior play neared its final rehearsals. Miss
Williams drove the cast without mercy for on
the success of the play would depend her own
opportunity for advancement.</p>
<p>Helen, working every spare moment, became
tired and irritable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad when it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
never dreamed it would be so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be well repaid when the play is
given,&rdquo; said Janet, who had been assigned to
the stage crew. In this capacity she attended
almost every rehearsal and she couldn&rsquo;t help
watching Margie go through the lines of Abbie.
It was a delightful part, easy to handle, and so
breezy and irresponsible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Costuming took several nights, for Miss Williams
was meticulous. Then came the dress
rehearsals, the first on Monday night. The
play would be given Friday. On the following
week came the junior-senior banquet and then
graduation and the end of school days.</p>
<p>Janet, watching the play in rehearsal each
night, came to know the lines of almost everyone
in the cast for the lighting of the show was
in her charge. It was up to her to get just the
right amount of amber in the afternoon scene
and just the right amount of blue to simulate
moonlight for the evening scene from the
rather antiquated banks of lights on each side
of the stage.</p>
<p>Brief letters and a telegram or two had come
from Helen&rsquo;s father, assuring her that he would
arrive in ample time for the presentation of
&ldquo;The Chinese Image.&rdquo; Janet&rsquo;s father had
found a small plot at the rear of their own large
lot which yielded an ample supply of worms at
almost every spadeful and Indian creek, two
miles north of Clarion, was said to abound with
bullheads that spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>On Wednesday night, after a long and tiring
rehearsal, Janet and Helen walked home
through the soft moonlight of the late May
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard from Dad today. He was
going to wire what train he would arrive on.
It looks like he won&rsquo;t be in until the morning
of the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be plenty of time. He can stay
on longer after the play&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be plenty of time if he has to do
any more retakes on his last picture. His
letters have sounded awfully tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk on down to Whet&rsquo;s for an
ice cream soda. The walk will do both of
us good and the soda will be refreshing,&rdquo; said
Janet.</p>
<p>Helen agreed and they walked leisurely,
breathing deeply of the flower-scented air; for
it was a perfect evening. From far away came
the rumble of heavy trucks on a through street,
but on their own there was an air of peace and
contentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad will like this when he finally gets here.
He always seems to throw off his cares when
he&rsquo;s back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is why he anticipates coming home
so much,&rdquo; added Janet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t go on this way forever. He
needs mother and I&rsquo;ll be going away to school
next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that until after
graduation. There&rsquo;ll be plenty of time to discuss
those matters then.&rdquo; Janet felt somewhat
like a very fatherly old man giving
advice to a very young girl and she smiled to
herself.</p>
<p>At the neighborhood drug store they
dawdled over their sodas, thoroughly relaxing
after the strenuous hours of rehearsal. On the
way home they again walked leisurely, discussing
little things about the play that appealed
to them.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s mother, waiting on the porch, called
to them the moment they came in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, Helen. I&rsquo;ve a telegram from
your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen ran across the lawn with Janet close
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming, isn&rsquo;t he, mother?&rdquo; And to
Janet there was something pitiful in Helen&rsquo;s
extreme anxiety for she was so desperately intent
upon having her father see her in the leading
r&ocirc;le in the class play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming tonight, dear. He wired saying
that he would be on the transcontinental
plane which stops at Rubio at midnight.
Janet&rsquo;s father and mother are going to drive
us over. You girls had better clean up a bit.
We&rsquo;re leaving right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I was afraid
it was a message saying he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet hurried on home. Her father had the
large sedan out in the driveway and her mother
was bustling about the kitchen, making stacks
of thin sandwiches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the sandwiches?&rdquo; asked Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known the time when Henry
Thorne wasn&rsquo;t hungry. He&rsquo;s been that way
ever since he was a little boy and his wife is too
excited to think about that. We&rsquo;ll have them
all over for lunch after we get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will be late. Way after one o&rsquo;clock
and Helen ought to be in bed. She has
been keeping terrific hours with the rehearsals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do her a bit of harm this time.
Being with her father will do her more good
than anything else. Wrap these sandwiches
up and put them in the breadbox so they&rsquo;ll keep
good and moist. Then slice some lemon for the
ice tea and put the slices back in the ice box.
We&rsquo;ll stop and get some ice cream on our way
in to town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>They hurried around the kitchen until
Janet&rsquo;s mother noticed the disarray of her
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For land&rsquo;s sake, Janet, you&rsquo;re a sight.
Working with the scenery and lights again at
school? Well, hurry upstairs and clean up.
Then slip into that pale green print that makes
your hair look golden. We&rsquo;ll be ready in five
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet forgot her fatigue and raced upstairs,
splashed water on her flushed cheeks, followed
that with a few hasty dabs of a powder puff to
take the shine off her skin, and then went to
her own room where she put on fresh, sheer
hose and the green print that was so becoming.</p>
<p>Her hair, with its natural curl, needed only
a quick brushing to bring out the highlights.</p>
<p>Down in the driveway her father pushed the
horn button and her mother called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready, Janet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But so was Janet and she hastened downstairs
and joined them. The sedan was one of
those extra-broad stream-lined cars with room
for three in the front seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You and Helen can sit up front with me
while your mother and Mrs. Thorne are in the
back seat,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;Coming back
we&rsquo;ll put the Thornes in the back where they
can visit to their heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car rolled down the drive and her father
turned and stopped the large, low machine in
front of the Thorne home. Half a dozen lights
were turned on downstairs and the house fairly
glowed with light.</p>
<p>Helen and her mother came down the walk,
Helen in a pink, fluffy creation that set off her
dark coloring to its best effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty enough to look like a
would-be movie star trying to make an impression
upon a famous director,&rdquo; whispered Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; smiled Helen as she slipped
into the front seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody ready?&rdquo; inquired Janet&rsquo;s
father. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get half way to
Rubio and have one of you women remember
that you&rsquo;ve left something important at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do the driving and we&rsquo;ll worry about
what&rsquo;s been left at home,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Hardy
with a chuckle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The big machine rolled away smoothly and
when they turned onto the main state road to
Rubio, John Hardy stepped on the accelerator
and they fairly flew down the straight, white
ribbon which unrolled before their blazing
lights.</p>
<p>The speedometer climbed steadily, fifty,
sixty and then seventy miles an hour, and the
needle hung there except when they swung
around one of the broad, well-banked curves.
Then it dropped to fifty.</p>
<p>The rush of cool air was refreshing and Janet
and Helen sank back in the broad, comfortable
seat.</p>
<p>When the lights of Rubio glowed ahead
Helen spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hardly seems possible that Dad will be
here in a few minutes. It&rsquo;s been months since
I&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll enjoy seeing him all the more.
What fun you&rsquo;re going to have the next few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be several weeks for I think
Dad needs a good rest. He&rsquo;s done three big
pictures in the last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rolled through Rubio to the airport,
which was just beyond the city limits. The
clock over the hangar pointed to 11:50 and
Janet&rsquo;s father guided the sedan to a stop in the
parking area behind the steel fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out if the plane&rsquo;s on time,&rdquo; he said,
and went over to the office.</p>
<p>Janet thought she could hear the faint, faraway
beat of an airplane, but the noise of another
car turning into the parking space
drowned it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on folks. The plane will be here in
a minute,&rdquo; called Mr. Hardy.</p>
<p>They hurried out of the car and followed
John Hardy through the gate and onto the
ramp. In the west were the red and green
lights of an incoming plane.</p>
<p>Suddenly the field burst into a flood of blue-white
brilliance as a great searchlight came on.
Like a ghost, the huge, twin-motored plane
glided down its invisible path and settled easily
onto a runway, little clouds of dust coming up
from the crushed rock as the machine touched
the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>With its motors roaring a lusty song of
power, the monoplane waddled toward the concrete
ramp. The pilot swung it smartly about
and the ground crew blocked the wheels and
rushed the landing stage up to the cabin door
as the pilot cut the motors. The propellers
ceased whirling just as the stewardess opened
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Dad!&rdquo; cried Helen and she ran
toward the plane with Janet at her heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br /><i>Chapter XII</i>
<br />ON THE STAGE</h2>
<p>Henry Thorne was the first passenger to
alight from the east-bound plane. Tall, well-built,
with a close-clipped mustache and iron
gray hair that curled a bit around his temples,
he was a man&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>Helen threw her arms around her father and
he gave her a tremendous hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, I&rsquo;m glad to see you, hon,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming. She couldn&rsquo;t run as fast as
I,&rdquo; explained Helen, breathless with excitement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thorne, her face flushed with happiness
over her husband&rsquo;s coming arrived and they
embraced affectionately.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Thorne saw John Hardy and
Janet and her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is great of you to come over.
I feel like a visiting celebrity, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very much a celebrity,&rdquo; smiled
Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s start
home. I&rsquo;ve only this light traveling bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean you won&rsquo;t be able to stay
long?&rdquo; asked Helen anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it doesn&rsquo;t. I can live for six
months out of a traveling bag. Oh, of course,
I wouldn&rsquo;t look like Beau Brummell, but I&rsquo;d
be acceptable in average circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Thornes occupied the back seat and
Janet and her mother sat in front. The big
car purred smoothly and Janet&rsquo;s father sent it
humming away on the trip back to Clarion.</p>
<p>Janet got only snatches of the conversation
that was going on in the rear seat. She was
anxious to listen, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have been
very polite to have done so obviously. Anyway,
Helen would tell her most of the news the
next day.</p>
<p>From the few remarks she overheard, she
realized that Henry Thorne was exceedingly
happy to be home, and that the last year had
been a strain even though all of his pictures had
been money makers.</p>
<p>The lights of Clarion were in sight when he
leaned forward and spoke to Janet&rsquo;s father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get any worms located, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of them and right in my own back
yard. You can dig to your heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the fishing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tried it myself, but the boys say
there are lots of bullheads in Indian creek.
Remember it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget the time we were hunting
rabbits and walked across the ice of the creek.
It wasn&rsquo;t frozen thick enough and we dropped
through into water waist deep. Going home
was the longest, coldest walk I&rsquo;ve ever taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t very pleasant,&rdquo; nodded Janet&rsquo;s
father. &ldquo;Did you hear about the experience of
the girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t read a paper for weeks. I&rsquo;ve been
going day and night on retakes for the last picture.
What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slowed down for the edge of Clarion
and Janet&rsquo;s father, briefly and vividly, recounted
the events of that harrowing night in
the storm and bitter cold of Little Deer valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have known about this,&rdquo; said
Henry Thorne quietly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t someone
wire me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of it,&rdquo; said Helen&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;but
it all happened so quickly. Then, after the girls
were safe at home I thought wiring you would
only prove disturbing and I knew you were
going to the limit of your strength and endurance
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he conceded, sinking
back in the rear seat. &ldquo;My, but it&rsquo;s great to
be home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Hardy swung the car into the drive and
they rolled up the grade to the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity you couldn&rsquo;t take a man to his own
door,&rdquo; chided his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will if you want to miss the
lunch that&rsquo;s waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They bantered good naturedly, for John
Hardy and Henry Thorne had been companions
since boyhood. Now their correspondence
was haphazard and infrequent, but
each anticipated their visits together.</p>
<p>Janet hastened to the kitchen to help her
mother with the lunch, placing the delicious,
thinly cut sandwiches on a large silver platter.
There was a heap of them, but it was late and
they were all hungry.</p>
<p>Her mother stopped halfway to the dining
room, a stricken look appearing on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I completely forgot to stop on the way
home and get ice cream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Janet looked at the clock. It was 1:15 a. m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late to find any place
near here open. We&rsquo;ll make out anyway with
sandwiches, cheese wafers and tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some chocolate cake left over from
yesterday,&rdquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll put that on. We&rsquo;ll have plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They bustled about and almost before they
knew it Janet was out on the porch announcing
that lunch was ready.</p>
<p>The Hardys sat on one side of the table and
the Thornes on the other, the conversation
shifting back and forth. The pile of sandwiches
dwindled rapidly, tea cups were refilled
two and three times and Henry Thorne was
noticed taking at least two slices of the thick,
delicious chocolate cake. John Hardy accused
him of taking three slices, but this he denied
strenuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m to be accused of eating three slices of
cake, I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;And
I won&rsquo;t be back until there&rsquo;s more cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get up early and bake a fresh one. It
will be ready by noon,&rdquo; said Janet&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be just about the time I&rsquo;m getting
up. Come on folks. We&rsquo;ve got to get some
sleep tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Goodnights were said quickly and with
Henry Thorne in the lead, the visitors departed
for their home.</p>
<p>Janet helped her mother clear away the
dishes. It was too late to wash them and they
were hastily stacked in the sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you think Henry looks?&rdquo; asked
John Hardy coming into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too tired and looks like he&rsquo;s been going
on nervous energy for simply days,&rdquo; replied
Janet&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the same impression. If we can
manage to make him forget that strenuous business
of his, of making successful motion pictures
he&rsquo;ll be able to build himself up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find plenty to interest himself in the
graduation program,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardy, &ldquo;and
if you take him on some fishing and loafing
expeditions along the creek he&rsquo;ll get a fine
chance to relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless they send a rush call from the coast
for him to return at once like they did a year
ago just after he had settled down to a fine
vacation. Well, staying up and talking doesn&rsquo;t
help the situation. Scoot for bed, Janet. It&rsquo;s
a good thing you aren&rsquo;t in the class play, what
with keeping such late hours as this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Up until the afternoon of the play Janet saw
very little of Helen&rsquo;s father. He was over to
the house once, but Helen informed her that
he had been sleeping and taking long drives
around the countryside with her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have so very much to visit about,&rdquo;
explained Helen, who was worn thin by the
strain of the last rehearsals. The night before
it had been midnight before they rang down
the curtain. Janet had been up equally as late
for her work on the meager lighting equipment
kept her on the job as long as the cast
rehearsed.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon they made a final check
of sets and lights and costumes and Miss Williams
rehearsed one or two of the minor characters
who had been causing more trouble than
the leads in getting their lines in just the way
she wanted them.</p>
<p>The gymnasium was filled with row upon
row of chairs. The old curtain which shielded
the stage had been refurbished and looked quite
presentable in spite of the landscape scene
which it depicted. Someday Janet hoped the
school would be able to buy adequate stage
equipment. The stage was large enough, but
the sets were pitifully few in number and all of
them several years old. They had been changed
a little here and there by the stagecraft class,
but underneath you could detect the same flats
and doors and windows of other years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>It was five o&rsquo;clock before they finally
straggled away from the gym and the call for
the entire cast and stage crew was 6:30 o&rsquo;clock
for Miss Williams wanted everyone on hand
early. Janet had seen the instructor conferring
with a rather distinguished looking man that
afternoon and guessed that he was the representative
of the producing company, there to
see the production and make the final decision
on offering a job to Miss Williams.</p>
<p>Janet, in spite of the fact that she was only a
member of the stage crew, found it hard to eat
even though supper that night was especially
delicious and her mother, although silent,
looked at her reprovingly.</p>
<p>Helen arrived before supper was over and
Janet was surprised to see her so calm. Perhaps
her father had been coaching her on composure.</p>
<p>Janet folded up a clean smock, tucked it
under one arm, and joined Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, girls,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
wait for you after the show and all have a lunch
down town to celebrate the event.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where your folks are going
to sit?&rdquo; asked Janet.</p>
<p>Helen shook her head. &ldquo;Dad wouldn&rsquo;t tell
me; thought if I knew I would be looking for
them and it might make me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first time a high school class has
ever performed before a famous Hollywood
director,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think of Dad in that way. Now
that he&rsquo;s back home he&rsquo;s just a neighbor and he
wants to be thought of in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but you can&rsquo;t keep the cast from
remembering that an ace director is in the
audience tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. I only hope it won&rsquo;t make
them too excited and upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been wondering up until tonight.
But now I&rsquo;ve made myself realize that he&rsquo;s just
Dad and that makes all of the difference in the
world. Sort of gives me the confidence that I
need for I know that if I make mistakes he&rsquo;ll
understand. I wish you were going to be
Abbie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not, and you&rsquo;ll get along all right
with Margie. I think she&rsquo;s really been working
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s worked hard enough, but somehow
she doesn&rsquo;t seem real in the character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m just crazy and silly enough
to make a very real Abbie?&rdquo; chided Janet.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s face flushed quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know better than that. Margie is
light-headed enough for the r&ocirc;le of Abbie, but
she lacks some spark of sincerity that&rsquo;s needed,
for after all, you know, Abbie finally solves the
riddle of the Chinese image and pulls out the
string of priceless pearls which saves the fortunes
of the Naughtons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cast and stage crew reported on time
and Miss Williams checked each of them in.
She devoted her own energies to making up the
principals while several other teachers, fairly
adept in dramatics, helped with the makeup of
the minor characters.</p>
<p>Janet put on her smock and checked the
lighting instructions which had been mimeographed
and placed it beside the small switchboard.
Actually she knew them all by heart,
but she wanted to be sure there would be no
mistake; no dimming of the lights when they
should be brightened nor a sudden blackout
in the middle of a love scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Margie Blake came up from one of the dressing
rooms. She was glorious in salmon-hued
taffeta and golden slippers.</p>
<p>Margie, fully aware of the striking picture
she made, walked slowly across the stage, which
had been set for the opening scene, the garden
of the Naughton home.</p>
<p>Ed Rickey was standing nearby and Janet
saw his eyes widen as they took in the beauty of
Margie and her costume. And Janet felt her
own heart tighten. Here she was in a smock,
with her hands none too clean, no wonder that
Ed had eyes only for Margie.</p>
<p>One of the sky drops was hanging unevenly
and Miss Williams sent one of the boys in the
stage crew up into the loft to adjust the lines
and even the drop. The dramatic instructor
stood in the middle of the stage motioning for
first one end of the drop and then the other to
be lifted or lowered.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a cry from the loft and
Janet, looking up, saw one end of the heavy
drop sagging. It hung there for a moment.
Then there was the sound of rending wood and
the drop hurtled down toward the stage.</p>
<p>Miss Williams leaped backward instinctively,
but Margie, seated on a garden bench,
didn&rsquo;t have a chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Janet tried to shout a warning, but the cry
jammed in her throat. Margie looked up and
Janet caught one terror-stricken look on her
face. Then the drop thudded to the floor, a
tangle of painted canvas enveloping Margie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br /><i>Chapter XIII</i>
<br />JANET STEPS IN</h2>
<p>Ed Rickey was the first to reach Margie.
With desperate hands he tore away the pile of
canvas, splintered wood and snarl of rope.
Jim Barron, who had rushed from the dressing
room with his makeup only half on, helped Ed
lift Margie to a nearby bench.</p>
<p>Then Miss Williams took charge. Margie
was breathing regularly, but her eyes were
closed. There was a nasty bump over her forehead
and her dress looked like it might have
been run over by a ten-ton truck, for a mass of
dust and grime had come down with the drop.</p>
<p>The boy who had been in the scene loft
scrambled down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pulleys let go!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Honestly,
Miss Williams, I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, and I don&rsquo;t think Margie is
badly hurt. She&rsquo;ll come around in a minute or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Someone brought a glass of water and Miss
Williams raised Margie&rsquo;s head and forced some
water between her lips.</p>
<p>After a time Margie opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was the storm?&rdquo; she mumbled.
Then, recognizing the anxious faces of the
members of the cast about her, struggled to sit
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hit me?&rdquo; she demanded thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pulleys gave way and a drop came
down,&rdquo; explained Ed.</p>
<p>Margie tried to stand up, but sat down
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;It feels ten sizes
too large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carry her downstairs,&rdquo; Miss Williams said
to Ed and Jim. While the boys were obeying
instructions, Miss Williams went to a telephone
and summoned a doctor.</p>
<p>It was 7:15 o&rsquo;clock then and the curtain was
set for eight. In just forty-five minutes the
show must go on and Margie had a splitting
headache and her costume was ruined at least
for the night.</p>
<p>When Doctor Bates, the school physician arrived,
it was 7:30 o&rsquo;clock and Margie, stretched
out on a couch in the girls&rsquo; dressing room, was
holding cold cloths on her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Doctor Bates&rsquo; examination was quick but
thorough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mild concussion, I&rsquo;d say. She must go to
bed at once and remain there, perfectly quiet,
for at least twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margie struggled to her feet and was as
promptly returned to the couch by the doctor,
who forced her to choke back her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
a part in the play and you&rsquo;ve got to go on.
That&rsquo;s the tradition of the theater. But this
isn&rsquo;t a theater. This is a high school play and
young lady you&rsquo;re not going to risk serious
injury to yourself by doing any such thing as
attempting to appear in this play. I&rsquo;m going to
take you home right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Bates, who usually had his way,
helped Margie out to his car. It was a tearful
and protesting Margie, but Miss Williams joined
in insisting that she go home and there was
nothing else for her to do.</p>
<p>By the time Margie was on her way home
the first rows of the gym were filling with
spectators and Miss Williams, a look of desperate
intent upon her face, called the cast
together on the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go on for this means so much
to me and to you. Try and forget, if you can,
what has happened to Margie. Do everything
you can to help the girl I&rsquo;m going to push into
Margie&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le. If she stumbles on her lines or
forgets them, fake until you can pick it up
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she swung toward Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get anything from home you can
wear for the first act&mdash;something very light
and pretty. You&rsquo;ll be able to wear the costumes
intended for Margie in the other two
acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you want me to step in and take
Margie&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le?&rdquo; asked Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I mean. You&rsquo;ve got
to do it. You&rsquo;re the only one who knows the
lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll make a terrible mess of
things; I&rsquo;ll spoil the whole show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Janet, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; There was
desperate entreaty in Miss Williams&rsquo; words.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard you repeating Margie&rsquo;s lines to
yourself at rehearsal. You know them all and
you know the action. Just imagine that you
were originally picked for the r&ocirc;le. You can
handle it, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Janet. This is our chance. We&rsquo;ll
be playing together tonight. I need you to
steady me.&rdquo; It was Helen speaking, saying she
needed Janet to steady her.</p>
<p>Janet smiled to herself. She would be the
one who would need bolstering.</p>
<p>Miss Williams came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found one of the boys with a car. He&rsquo;ll
take you home and bring you back with a costume
for the first act. I don&rsquo;t want to hold the
curtain unless absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it,&rdquo; promised Janet.</p>
<p>There was no one at home and she rushed
upstairs and dove into the large wardrobe in
her room. She had been wondering all the way
home what to select. Probably that pale green
silk print. She&rsquo;d only worn it once or twice,
and never to anything at school.</p>
<p>Janet seized the dress, slipped out of the
smock and everyday dress she had worn under
that, and wiggled into the cool, crisp silk.
Stockings and shoes were changed in a flash.
Pausing just a moment before her mirror, she
brushed her hair vigorously until the light
caught all of its natural golden glints. Then
she ran down stairs, breathless from the rush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>It was two minutes to eight, just two minutes
before the curtain was scheduled to go up,
when Janet reached the stage. Miss Williams
was pacing nervously when she hurried on, but
she stopped instantly and eyed Janet approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid, dear, splendid. We&rsquo;ll start on
time. If you forget some of the lines, just
make up a few sentences until you can recall
them. The rest of the cast will help you carry
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen, dark and radiant, came out of the
wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need a little more color on your cheeks.
You look as pale as a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel pretty much like a ghost,&rdquo; confessed
Janet as they slipped into a dressing room where
Helen adeptly applied a touch of rouge, used
an eyebrow pencil sparingly, and then finished
the makeup with just enough lipstick to accentuate
the charm of Janet&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody ready?&rdquo; It was Miss Williams,
calling the cast together for a final checkup.</p>
<p>Fortunately Janet would not go on until the
middle of the first act. It would give her an
opportunity to regain her full composure, to
get into the swing of the play, and to brush up
on any lines she was afraid she might forget.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>The music of the high school orchestra,
which was playing in the pit out front, reached
a crescendo and died away. Janet faintly heard
a wave of applause for the efforts of the orchestra.
Then the girl who had taken her place at the
switchboard dimmed the house lights, shoved
the switch that sent the electricity surging
into the footlights, and the curtain started up.</p>
<p>There was that little breathless pause before
the action of the play began. Then Helen, the
first character on the stage, started her lines.
Clearly, confidently, she spoke, and Janet&rsquo;s
fears for the play, fears for any mistakes of her
own, melted away. Helen was going magnificently,
perfectly at ease and seemingly living
the very r&ocirc;le of Gale Naughton.</p>
<p>Janet slipped into the mood of the play. It
wasn&rsquo;t hard for she had attended every rehearsal
and knew the lines of almost every
character.</p>
<p>On the other side of the stage Miss Williams,
the prompt book in her hands, was obviously
pleased.</p>
<p>Then came a cue that awoke Janet from the
pleasant glow. She was on next. With hands
that fluttered just a little she picked up a mirror
on the tiny dressing table in the wings and made
sure that her hair was right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>It was time for her to go on, a rollicking,
bouncing sort of entrance that one would expect
from gay, light-hearted Abbie Naughton,
and Janet did it perfectly.</p>
<p>The blaze of light from the footlights
shielded her from the audience. She didn&rsquo;t
need to care what they were thinking. All she
needed to do was to go through her part, playing
it to the utmost. Later she would know
what the audience thought, but then it would
be too late to matter.</p>
<p>Janet and Helen had a fast exchange of lines,
Helen reproving Janet for her gayety when the
family funds were so low. They carried that
hard bit of repartee off successfully and when
the conversation swung to another character,
Helen whispered under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re grand, simply grand. Keep it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double the compliment for yourself,&rdquo; replied
Janet, her lips barely moving yet the
words were audible to Helen.</p>
<p>The first act was over suddenly. The curtain
came down, smoothly, silently, and as it
bumped the floor a gathering wave of applause
echoed throughout the gym. Miss Williams
nodded and the curtain went up again, the
members of the cast smiling and bowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Then came the rush for the second act. The
stage must be reset and the girls, especially, had
to put on new costumes. Miss Williams
stopped Janet in the wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margie&rsquo;s costumes for the last two acts are
laid out in the dressing room. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll
fit.&rdquo; Then she laughed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to,
Janet. We can&rsquo;t stop for a costume, can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not after the first act,&rdquo; replied Janet.</p>
<p>But Margie&rsquo;s costumes did fit. It was as
though they had been made for Janet.</p>
<p>The action of the play moved more rapidly,
swirling closer and closer around the Chinese
image on its pedestal in the garden.</p>
<p>Finally came the third act with Janet,
clumsy, jubilant Janet, accidentally knocking
over the image, which burst open when it
struck the stage floor and there, inside the figure
of clay, was the secret of the image and the continued
comfort of the Naughtons&mdash;a ruby, so
perfect, so beautiful, that it was worth an exceedingly
large fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Before Janet knew it the curtain came down
for the final time and on its echo came a sustained
wave of applause. First the cast, then
Miss Williams, and then the cast, answered the
steady calls for their appearance. When Janet
and Helen, coming out hand in hand, took a
bow, the applause reached a new peak and then
died away as the audience, satisfied as having
paid tribute to the two stars of the show, prepared
to leave the spacious gymnasium.</p>
<p>There was the usual crowd on the stage, parents
and friends rushing up to congratulate
members of the cast and over in one corner
Janet saw Miss Williams signing her name to a
paper that looked very much like a contract.
Without doubt the dramatics instructor had
earned her contract with the producing company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; announced Helen, in a very
matter-of-fact manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I am, too, but I&rsquo;m still far too excited
to realize it,&rdquo; replied Janet. &ldquo;Here come
the folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father and mother, closely followed by
Helen&rsquo;s parents, were pushing their way
through the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty proud of you two,&rdquo; said John
Hardy as he gave each of them a hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more than that,&rdquo; chuckled Helen&rsquo;s
father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tempted to sign them to contracts
and take them back to Hollywood with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br /><i>Chapter XIV</i>
<br />JUST FISHING</h2>
<p>Henry Thorne&rsquo;s words echoed in Janet&rsquo;s
ears as the girls changed their costumes in the
dressing room. Of course he must have been
saying it lightly, paying them a pleasant compliment
for their work. She forced herself to
dismiss it from serious consideration.</p>
<p>They changed quickly, hung up their costumes,
and hurried out to join their parents for
Henry Thorne was entertaining at dinner down
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the idea of telling us you were in
charge of lighting when you actually played
the second lead?&rdquo; Janet&rsquo;s mother asked after
they had left the gym and were rolling down
town in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mother, I told the truth. I was in
charge of lighting until about twenty minutes
before the curtain went up. Then one of the
drops broke away and fell on Margie. She suffered
a minor concussion and it was up to someone
to step in and take the part or the show
would have flopped right then and there before
the curtain went up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you stepped in cold and handled
the second lead?&rdquo; asked Henry Thorne, turning
around in the front seat to gaze incredulously
at Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t hard. You see I tried out for
that r&ocirc;le and then I attended every rehearsal.
Of course I sort of lived the character I tried
out for. I missed some of the lines tonight, but
the others knew I might and they covered up
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be darned. I thought you had
been rehearsing it from the first and had told
us you were on lights just to surprise us,&rdquo; said
the famous director. &ldquo;Anyway, you did a
swell job. Maybe I will take you back to the
coast with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Henry,&rdquo; protested his wife, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
start saying things you don&rsquo;t mean. You&rsquo;ll get
the girls all excited and then you&rsquo;ll have to rush
away to start work on another picture and
you&rsquo;ll forget all about your promises to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably you&rsquo;re right mother, but they&rsquo;re
smart, good looking girls, even if one of them
is my daughter, and heavens knows we could
use some really smart, level-headed girls in one
of my companies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s father wheeled the car in to the curb
in front of the restaurant where they were to
have dinner and in the bustle of getting out of
the car conversation switched to another topic,
but Henry Thorne&rsquo;s words persisted in sticking
in Janet&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Henry Thorne had planned and ordered the
supper himself. It was a man&rsquo;s meal and Janet
and Helen, now tremendously hungry after the
strain of the play, enjoyed it to the utmost.</p>
<p>First there was chilled tomato juice and in
the center of the table a heaping platter of
celery, olives and pickled onions that they ate
with relish through all of the courses of the
dinner.</p>
<p>Then came great sizzling steaks, thick and
almost swimming in their own juice, french
fried potatoes, a liberal head lettuce salad,
small buttered peas, hot rolls and jam. And
after that there was open-face cherry pie and
coffee for those who cared for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is your idea of a meal, Henry?&rdquo;
asked his wife, surveying the welter of dishes
on the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps not every day and every
meal, but once in a while I&rsquo;d say yes. This is
my idea of a meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s been grand,&rdquo; spoke up Janet&rsquo;s
mother, &ldquo;especially since I didn&rsquo;t have to do
any work toward it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does make a difference,&rdquo; conceded
Mrs. Thorne, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d hate to think of Henry&rsquo;s
waistline if he had a meal like this every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conversation turned to neighborhood issues
and talk of the town, for Henry Thorne maintained
a tremendously active interest in the affairs
of his home city.</p>
<p>When they finally started home, it was well
after one o&rsquo;clock, but routine school days for
Janet and Helen were at an end. Exams were
over and there was only the junior-senior banquet
and then commencement.</p>
<p>Janet slept late the next morning and it was
after ten o&rsquo;clock when her mother finally
awakened her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen and her father just phoned they are
coming over. I thought you might like to go
with them. After they get some worms out of
the back yard they&rsquo;re going fishing. I&rsquo;ll put
up a lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Janet hurried into her clothes and met Helen
and her father as they arrived. Henry Thorne
was armed with an ancient cane fishpole, had
on a venerable straw hat, cracked but comfortable
shoes, old overalls and a blue shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s thoroughly disreputable looking,&rdquo;
said Helen, laughing at her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted, my dear, but I&rsquo;m most thoroughly
comfortable, which is the main thing.
I wouldn&rsquo;t trade this old fishing outfit for the
best suit of clothes in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet showed them a corner of the back lot
that promised to be productive of worms, and
then went in the house for her own breakfast.
She ate on the kitchen table while her mother
packed a basket of lunch to be taken by the
anglers.</p>
<p>It was a grand morning for a fishing expedition
and especially if those going fishing really
didn&rsquo;t care whether they caught any fish or
not. Just before they left Janet&rsquo;s father arrived
and hastily changed into old clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go to the creek in the car?&rdquo; asked
John Hardy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life. We&rsquo;re walking, both
ways,&rdquo; grinned Henry Thorne, and the men,
the cane poles over their shoulders, started for
the creek. Helen carried the can of worms and
Janet took the lunch basket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Indian creek was a pleasant stream, meandering
through the rolling hills north of Clarion.
Its waters were clear, alternating in quiet pools
and swift little riffles over its gravel bed.</p>
<p>The air was mild and there was scarcely a
cloud in the sky. They went up the creek for
more than a mile before Henry Thorne found
a pool that looked like it might have a few
bullheads. The foliage overhead was thick
and the water here looked almost turgid, far
different from the clear stream which danced
along its bed farther down.</p>
<p>The men baited their hooks and Janet and
Helen sat down to watch the fishermen.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s father got the first bite, but he failed
to land his fish. After that there was a long
interval when the fishermen failed to talk and
the fish failed to bite. Then the bullheads all
seemed hungry and Janet&rsquo;s father was the first
to land one, but Henry Thorne was right behind
him with a larger catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut a willow stick for a stringer,&rdquo; said
Helen&rsquo;s father, tossing a knife to her, and
Helen, knowing exactly what was needed,
found a forked willow and trimmed it down.</p>
<p>In less than an hour they had eleven bullheads
on the willow stick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s plenty,&rdquo; decided Janet&rsquo;s father.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use spoiling the fun by taking
more than we need. Shall we have them for
supper tonight at my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing. We&rsquo;ll have them right
here. Remember when we were kids and
used to clean them along the creek, put them
on a stick, and try and cook them over a
fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s father nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do right now.
We&rsquo;ll clean the fish while the girls get some
dry sticks and build a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus they had their noon meal, bullheads
off the spit, crisp and hot, with just a sprinkle
of salt on them, sandwiches and fruit from the
basket, and cool, sweet water from a nearby
spring.</p>
<p>Henry Thorne, his appetite appeased, his
mind and body relaxed, stretched out on the
grass and looked meditatively into the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a life this would be&mdash;no strain, no
thoughts of tomorrow, no temperamental stars
to worry about, no stories to doctor, no budget
to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But after what you&rsquo;ve had this would tire
in a few weeks. Why, you&rsquo;re thinking about
getting back into the harness right now,&rdquo; said
Janet&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Henry Thorne flushed guiltily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught that time,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Sure
I was thinking about getting back on the job.
I&rsquo;m too much of a work horse, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll stay until after graduation,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Helen anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing you needn&rsquo;t worry about,&rdquo;
promised her father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking now of
what&rsquo;s going to be best for you after high school
days are over; whether you and mother will
prefer to stay here in Clarion or would like to
come west with me. You&rsquo;re pretty much of
a young woman now, Helen, and from the play
last night, quite a capable little actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of an actress, I&rsquo;m afraid, Dad,
but I did want to be in the class play because
you were coming home and I wanted you to be
proud of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very proud of you, dear. Just how
proud you&rsquo;ll never know, and I&rsquo;ve been trying
to think of something I could do that would
show you just how pleased I was over the work
you and Janet did in the class play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>They were silent for a time, all of them enjoying
the quiet charm of the afternoon.
Henry Thorne puffed slowly on a venerable
pipe while Janet&rsquo;s father dozed, his hat pulled
down to shield his eyes from the sun. The
embers of their fire turned black and then grey
as they cooled.</p>
<p>Janet thoroughly enjoyed relaxing on the
creek bank. School days were almost over and
she couldn&rsquo;t help wondering what the summer
and the coming year would hold in store for
her. Of course there would be college in the
fall, but just where had not been determined.
It was generally understood at home, though,
that she would be allowed to make her own
choice providing it was anywhere near within
reason.</p>
<p>Janet knew that Helen&rsquo;s plans were very uncertain.
Her friend wasn&rsquo;t even sure that they
would continue to make their home in Clarion.</p>
<p>Just then Henry Thorne knocked the ashes
out of his pipe and squinted at the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better be starting home,&rdquo; he said. He
picked up a small stick and tossed it at Janet&rsquo;s
father, who awoke with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on sleepy-head. Time to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet finished packing the few utensils that
went back into the lunch basket while the men
wound up the lines on their fishpoles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>They started home, walking leisurely in the
warm afternoon, the men leading the way.</p>
<p>Half a mile down the creek they came upon
a farm boy, riding bareback. The horse was
a beautiful, spirited animal, and the lad rode
with amazing grace. They paused for several
minutes to watch the horse and rider until they
finally disappeared over a nearby hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can either of you girls ride?&rdquo; Henry
Thorne asked the question almost sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, but not much nor very well,&rdquo; confessed
Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong in the same class,&rdquo; added Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any place in town where we can
find good horses and a good instructor?&rdquo;
Helen&rsquo;s father shot the question at John
Hardy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hill and Dale farm keeps a fine string of
horses. I&rsquo;m sure I could arrange for instruction
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you this evening and we&rsquo;ll see
what can be done. I want the girls to become
proficient at riding as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just another quirk of mine,&rdquo; smiled her
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>As soon as they reached home Henry Thorne
urged Janet&rsquo;s father to accompany him to see
about riding lessons for the girls and just before
dinner returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your first lesson will be at eight o&rsquo;clock
to-morrow morning,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Look
up some old duds that won&rsquo;t be hurt if you fall
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the girls?&rdquo; demanded his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to take a chance on that,&rdquo; he
smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br /><i>Chapter XV</i>
<br />HOLLYWOOD BOUND</h2>
<p>Janet remained awake for some time that
night, wondering what the significance of
Henry Thorne&rsquo;s decision to have her and Helen
learn to ride, and ride well, could be. Finally
she gave it up as a bad job, realizing that he
would tell them in his own good time.</p>
<p>Graduation week passed in a mixed whirl of
events, with the junior-senior banquet and
actual graduation exercises interspersed between
the long hours passed at Hill and Dale
farm where Janet and Helen underwent an
intensive series of lessons on horsemanship.
Both girls were agile and anxious to learn, and
both soon came to enjoy the riding thoroughly.
Their instructor, an older man, found them
eager pupils and Helen&rsquo;s father encouraged
them at each lesson, for he went with them on
every trip to the farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Like the senior class play, the graduation exercises
were held in the gymnasium and Helen
stopped for Janet. They were going on ahead
of their parents for they had to be at school
half an hour before the start of the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t smell like a stable,&rdquo; smiled
Helen, radiant in her crisp, white organdie dress.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been at the farm so much I almost
say &lsquo;Giddap&rsquo; every time I start to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel almost the same way. One good
thing, though, I can sit down comfortably now
and I couldn&rsquo;t after the first two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came down from Janet&rsquo;s room,
Helen&rsquo;s father and mother were there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re early, but I want to talk to your
folks,&rdquo; Henry Thorne told Janet. &ldquo;You
youngsters run along and we&rsquo;ll be there in
plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were on their way to school,
Helen spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s been acting so mysteriously the last
two days and mother seems to be unusually
happy about something. This morning Dad
put in a call for Hollywood, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
talk from home; went down to a pay station.
I asked mother what was up, but she said not
for me to worry as long as she wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he isn&rsquo;t going back west,&rdquo; suggested
Janet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Dad. I heard him mumbling
just this afternoon about some kind of a
story idea. You know he usually sits in on the
final drafting of all of the stories he produces.
I expect that as soon as graduation is over he&rsquo;ll
start back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he said anything more about taking
you with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word lately and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
puzzled about. Neither Dad nor mother have
talked about what I&rsquo;m to do next fall. You
know I&rsquo;d like to go to school with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like to have you, Helen. I&rsquo;ll be
lost if we aren&rsquo;t able to hit it off together.
We&rsquo;ve had such good times through high school
and especially this last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final meeting of the seniors, as a class,
was held in the assembly, the girls in their snow-white
dresses and the boys all in their dark
suits made a pleasing contrast. Some of them
were visibly nervous while others remained unusually
calm. To some it was a momentous
event while others took it as the last step in a
tiresome school career.</p>
<p>Margie Blake, still white and feeling none
too strong, was near the door when Janet and
Helen entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Janet started to speak, but Margie deliberately
turned her back, and Janet, shocked and
hurt, looked at her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why do you suppose she did that?&rdquo;
she asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to tell you, but you might
as well know,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Margie is hinting
around that she suspects you had something
to do with the injury she suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that I contrived to have that
piece of scenery fall on her just so I could get
her part in the play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what Margie&rsquo;s hinting. Of
course she isn&rsquo;t saying that openly, but she
doesn&rsquo;t give you much room to guess what she
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to have a word with Margie
right now. That&rsquo;s one thing I won&rsquo;t stand
for.&rdquo; Janet&rsquo;s face was flushed and she
was furiously angry when she confronted
Margie.</p>
<p>Margie&rsquo;s eyes widened and Helen thought
she saw her hands tremble just a little. Perhaps
she surmised that Janet was on the warpath
and that she was the cause of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Margie, I&rsquo;ve been told that you are insinuating
I was responsible for the accident which
forced you out of the play and gave me your
place. Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s words were low enough so that only
Margie and Helen could hear, but there was
a compelling force in them that would not be
denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, that&rsquo;s not so. I never said you
caused the accident.&rdquo; Margie stammered and
flushed hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to accuse me of this thing,&rdquo;
she added defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a very good right if you are dropping
hints about me and the accident the night of
the play. If you&rsquo;ve been doing that all I&rsquo;ve got
to say is that you&rsquo;re smaller than I ever dreamed
you could be. You&rsquo;re simply below contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet whirled and left Margie with tears
in her eyes. Helen paused a moment for
Margie seemed about to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about what I&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo; Margie
managed to say. &ldquo;I guess I was a little indiscreet,
but you tell Janet I won&rsquo;t say anything
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her and I think you&rsquo;ll be a very
wise girl if you decide to let the whole thing
drop,&rdquo; advised Helen, turning to rejoin Janet,
who had gone to the other side of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The principal was giving his final words of
instruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As your names are called for the presentation
of diplomas, each of you will come from
your places to the platform, receive a tube of
paper, and return. After the exercises are over
come to me in this room and I will present your
real diplomas. If you can not come here after
the close of the exercises, call at my office tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a moment, then added, &ldquo;and I
should like to say that I am extremely proud
of this class. I think it is the finest to graduate
from Clarion High in the eight years I have
been principal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which,&rdquo; whispered Helen, &ldquo;is quite a compliment,
if you ask me. It&rsquo;s the first he ever
paid this class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sort of made up for the lack before by
these last words,&rdquo; smiled Janet.</p>
<p>Again they went onto the stage of the gymnasium,
but this time not as actors and actresses
in a play of make believe, but in the
very serious business of graduating from high
school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>The gymnasium was filled with parents and
friends of the seniors. The air was close, portending
the storm that was to break later. Fortunately
the program was simple, the address
by the superintendent of schools lasting only
fifteen minutes. Then the names were called
and one by one they went forward and when
they came back their high school days were
over.</p>
<p>It had been grand, being in school, decided
Janet, and now she felt just a little scared. Life
was ahead and life was so vast and uncomprehending
and she knew it could be cold and
cruel and merciless.</p>
<p>They bowed their heads at the benediction,
there was a final swell of music from the orchestra
and the lights in the gymnasium glared.
It was over and Janet, in that moment, felt
years older. She was a high school girl no
longer....</p>
<p>Parents and friends of the graduates crowded
around them and Janet saw her father beckoning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your diplomas,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
meet you outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet and Helen went up to the assembly
where they turned in the paper scrolls which
had been presented to them at the program. In
return they received their real diplomas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Outside they found their parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were tremendously proud of both of
you,&rdquo; said Janet&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;You were by far
the prettiest girls on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cast my vote in support of that statement,&rdquo;
put in Helen&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s from
someone who should know a pretty girl when
he sees one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had planned a light supper at Thorne&rsquo;s
and all of them enjoyed the walk home for the
air was close. Dark banks of clouds, illuminated
once in a while by flashes of lightning,
were mounting higher and higher in the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;ll get a real one tonight,&rdquo; said
Janet&rsquo;s father, and the others agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize that the folks haven&rsquo;t given
us anything for graduation?&rdquo; whispered Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly any concrete gift just
now, but they&rsquo;ve given me a lot of character
and a sense of realization of the finer and honest
things of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, silly, of course I realize that, but Dad
has been so mysterious today I know something
is in the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached Helen&rsquo;s home they
sat down to an informal supper in the dining
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>On two plates were envelopes, one marked
&ldquo;Janet&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;Helen.&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s
father was puffing rather furiously at his pipe
as he watched the girls, their fingers clumsy
from their haste, rip open the envelopes.</p>
<p>Long green slips of paper, looking very much
like railroad tickets, came out of the envelopes.
Helen was the first to read hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a round trip
ticket by airplane to Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is mine,&rdquo; gasped Janet. &ldquo;What does this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father chuckling, nodded toward Henry
Thorne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say that it meant a round trip to Los
Angeles. Also, if you&rsquo;ll dig a little further
into your envelopes, you&rsquo;ll find reservations for
the westbound plane out of Rubio just one
week from tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad, we didn&rsquo;t know anything about
this,&rdquo; gasped Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been a
surprise,&rdquo; chuckled her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously though,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I liked your
performances in the high school play and I&rsquo;ve
talked it all over with Janet&rsquo;s folks and with
mother here. You&rsquo;re going back to Hollywood
to spend the summer with me and this morning
I contracted the production unit of our company
which makes cowboy films and both of
you are to have a chance in the cast of that
picture. You&rsquo;re Hollywood bound, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br /><i>Chapter XVI</i>
<br />THRILLING HOURS</h2>
<p>Janet was speechless and Helen was the first
to give vent to her thoughts in words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, it&rsquo;s grand of you, but it
doesn&rsquo;t seem possible.&rdquo; She looked at the
ticket again, feeling it to see if it actually was
real.</p>
<p>Tears brimmed into Janet&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy I could cry,&rdquo; she confessed.
Then added quickly, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know how I
can thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try now,&rdquo; smiled Henry Thorne.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more than repaid if you two make good
in the western pictures I&rsquo;m going to try to put
you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad, we&rsquo;ve never had any experience
like that,&rdquo; protested Helen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably
be awful flops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. It doesn&rsquo;t take much acting
ability to get by in the &lsquo;horse operas&rsquo; as we call
them. You just act natural, look pretty, and
you&rsquo;ll have all of the cowboys in the cast asking
you for dates.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Janet looked at her mother, wondering just
how she had been won over to letting them go
to Hollywood, even though Helen&rsquo;s father
would be there to oversee things in general.</p>
<p>Just then Mrs. Thorne spoke, pulling an envelope
from a pocketbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only lucky ones,&rdquo; she reminded
Janet and Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going along
and see that you are properly chaperoned when
these dashing cowboys ask you to go places with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That explained to Janet why her mother had
consented for with Mrs. Thorne along she
would have little to worry about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean we&rsquo;re going to leave Clarion
for good?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; boomed her father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be
lost if I didn&rsquo;t have Clarion to come back to for
a rest when I get fagged out and I don&rsquo;t know
what the bullheads out in Indian creek would
do without me. We&rsquo;re going to keep the place
here for you never know when even a famous
Hollywood director will start turning out poor
pictures and once you hit the toboggan out
there, it&rsquo;s hard to come back. I&rsquo;ve been at it
so long now, that another year will just about
see me through. Then I&rsquo;ll want to retire to
some quiet city and Clarion suits me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that, Dad, for I&rsquo;ve grown up
here and it would be so hard to think of cutting
all of the ties of friendship at just one sweep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to do that, Helen, and
maybe, if you two youngsters can&rsquo;t make the
grade with our western company, you&rsquo;ll be
back here before you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re leaving in just a week. It doesn&rsquo;t
seem possible,&rdquo; said Janet, half to herself and
half to the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time will go before you know it,&rdquo; said
her mother, &ldquo;what with the packing we&rsquo;ll have
to do and the new clothes to buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s stop right there,&rdquo; put in Helen&rsquo;s
father. &ldquo;Packing is all well and good, but let&rsquo;s
cut out the new clothes. Instead of loading
the girls up with things here, we&rsquo;ll give Mother
the money and she can let them have it in Hollywood
when they see a dress in the shops out
there that they want. I think they&rsquo;ll feel a little
more in style in Hollywood clothes than in
Clarion clothes in Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they would,&rdquo; confessed Janet&rsquo;s
mother, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid the money for Janet&rsquo;s
summer clothes allowance won&rsquo;t go very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be getting a regular salary each week
and the company will furnish whatever costumes
are needed for each picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each picture,&rdquo; smiled Helen. &ldquo;I like that
Dad. How long does it take to make a picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m directing anywhere from six
weeks to three or four months, but the western
company moves pretty rapidly. They&rsquo;ll grind
the average one out in two weeks or three at
the most. They&rsquo;re after action and plenty of
scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which explains why we were carted off
to Hill and Dale farm and hoisted up on horses
and jogged up and down for hours until I
thought every bone in my body would be
broken,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good guess. I&rsquo;ve had this idea in mind
ever since the night of the class play,&rdquo; confessed
Helen&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;re going to
get out of the riding class the rest of the time
you&rsquo;re in Clarion you&rsquo;ll be sadly mistaken. I&rsquo;m
certainly not going to show up on the lot and
ask Billy Fenstow to take on a couple of girls
who can&rsquo;t ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Billy Fenstow?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He runs our western unit. Billy writes
most of the stories, does the supervising and
directing and just about everything else about
the picture. You&rsquo;ll like him. He&rsquo;s fat, forty,
bald and lots of fun and if he likes you, he&rsquo;ll invite
you to the Brown Derby for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fun that would be,&rdquo; exclaimed Janet.
&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s where all of the stars go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You usually find a few of them eating
there,&rdquo; admitted Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>They talked for another hour, the girls, in
their excitement, planning things that could
never come true, but their fathers and mothers,
indulging them the sheer joy of their mood,
let them ramble on.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight when they finally
pushed their chairs away from the table and
the Hardys started for home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you first thing in the morning,&rdquo; said
Helen, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll sleep a wink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; replied Janet,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m so excited I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way home she linked her arm with
her father and mother and they walked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; her father asked gently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gloriously happy,&rdquo; replied Janet softly,
squeezing her mother&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Of course I want
to go to Hollywood, but I&rsquo;m going to miss both
of you terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss you, too. You know that,&rdquo; replied
her father, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s an opportunity that
comes to few girls. Don&rsquo;t be too disappointed
if you fail to remain in the cast of that western
picture. You&rsquo;re going out there for a lark and
not with the serious intent of becoming a motion
picture actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet bit her lips. Of course her dad was
right. She couldn&rsquo;t seriously hope to be a motion
picture actress, but for just a moment she
had found herself dreaming of real fame and
fortune in Hollywood. Why it WAS just a
lark, a sort of super vacation that only Helen&rsquo;s
father could make possible for them.</p>
<p>In the fall, after the summer on the film lots,
they would probably come back to the middle
west for Janet knew her father favored her
entering the state university, Janet resolutely
set her mind right. She must realize that it was
to be only a vacation lark. Then she could come
back happy and without regret when the summer
was at an end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br /><i>Chapter XVII</i>
<br />ON THE WESTBOUND PLANE</h2>
<p>The week following graduation was a hectic
one for Janet and Helen. There were the riding
lessons each day, their wardrobes to be gone
over, new shoes and hose to be purchased and
they finally decided that each of them needed
at least two new dresses to last until they could
get into the shops in Hollywood and select
things they desired there. It was fortunate
that Janet&rsquo;s father was a successful lawyer and
Helen&rsquo;s a famous director or their personal
pocketbooks would have been much thinner at
the end of the shopping expeditions.</p>
<p>Neither Janet nor Helen told their friends
of their plans, but somehow the story got
around that they were going to Hollywood
and had already signed for r&ocirc;les in a new picture.
Some said they were to have parts in
Henry Thorne&rsquo;s next production while others
claimed the girls were going to be bathing
beauties in a series of comedies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now wouldn&rsquo;t that make you boil,&rdquo; said
Helen, as she related a conversation between
Cora Dean and Margie Blake which she had
overheard. &ldquo;I was half way minded to step
in and tell them the truth, but then I realized
that was just what they wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were sitting on the Hardy&rsquo;s front
porch and the telephone summoned Janet inside.
She called Helen to her a few seconds
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pete Benda of the <i>Times</i>. He says he&rsquo;s
heard the story and if we won&rsquo;t confirm it he
will print all of the rumors going the rounds,
including the one that we&rsquo;re going to be bathing
beauties. What shall I tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him we&rsquo;re going to Hollywood with
Dad for a vacation and if we get in any pictures
we&rsquo;ll send him an autographed picture,&rdquo;
suggested Helen, which Janet promptly did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete isn&rsquo;t satisfied, but I guess he won&rsquo;t
print all of the rumors,&rdquo; reported Janet as she
hung up the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can just bet that Cora and Margie ran
up to the <i>Times</i> office and filled Pete full of
hot air,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I thought maybe after
we were out of high school things would be
different. I&rsquo;d like to be friendly with them for
they can be delightful when they want to be,
but both of them are still carrying a chip on
their shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>There was only one more afternoon of fishing
and loafing along the banks of the creek
and John Hardy went with Janet, Helen and
Henry Thorne on the outing. Their luck was
with them again and they hooked a fine mess
of catfish and fried them over an open fire.
Through the late afternoon Janet and Helen
talked incessantly of their hopes and plans
while at a distance their fathers dozed along
the creek bank.</p>
<p>It was dusk before they started home, walking
slowly through the twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the last night at home,&rdquo; Janet&rsquo;s
father reminded her. &ldquo;Tomorrow night we
go to Rubio and you take the west-bound
plane for Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hardly seems possible, but it must be so,&rdquo;
said Janet. &ldquo;Everything is like a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be until you actually arrive and start
work in the studio.&rdquo; Janet&rsquo;s father was silent
for several minutes. When he spoke again his
voice was so low that it could not be overheard
by Helen and her father, who were walking a
short distance ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expecting you to turn into a motion
picture actress, but I want you to do your
best out there. The change will be a fine vacation
and when you&rsquo;re actually on the lot working
before the cameras, give it everything
you&rsquo;ve got. That will add to the pleasure you&rsquo;ll
have in later years when you look back on this
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, Dad. I&rsquo;ll do the best possible job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know you will. It&rsquo;s going to be
lonesome here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but the break had
to come sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going away for good, Dad.
Only for the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You&rsquo;ll be home in the fall and
we&rsquo;ll make plans for school then. Have you
thought anything more about the university?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad I wasn&rsquo;t a boy, Dad, then I could
have tried for football there.&rdquo; There was just
a note of seriousness in Janet&rsquo;s voice for her
father was an All-American halfback at Corn
Belt U. and she knew he had always secretly
been a little disappointed when she proved to
be a girl, for there was no chance of a girl becoming
an All-American halfback.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Football isn&rsquo;t everything,&rdquo; replied her
father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied,&rdquo; and he said it with a
conviction that brought joy to Janet&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Through the evening hours Janet and her
mother checked over the last minute packing.
Trunks had been sent ahead by express and only
the essentials were going to be carried in the
bags they would take on the plane.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s luggage was attractive, but not expensive,
for her father had never believed in
undue waste of money.</p>
<p>That night Janet found it difficult to get to
sleep. Tomorrow night they would be winging
westward at three miles or more a minute
and by the noon of the second day would be
landing at the Grand Central airport at Glendale,
from where they could motor over to
Hollywood.</p>
<p>Finally sleep came and Janet dropped into
the dreamless slumber of youth. It was mid-morning
when she finally awakened as her
mother shook her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to get up,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardy, &ldquo;for
there&rsquo;s much to be done today before you start
for Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet leaped out of bed for in spite of all of
the preparations they had been making through
the last week there were a hundred and one
small things that remained to be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The hours fairly melted away. She made
three or four trips down town on hurried
errands and as many over to Helen&rsquo;s, where the
same hurry and bustle prevailed.</p>
<p>At dinner time her mother made her slow
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Of
course you may have forgotten one or two
things, but they aren&rsquo;t important, and they
can be sent on later. Now you take it easy
and enjoy dinner for this is the last one you&rsquo;ll
have with your father and me for some weeks.
My Janet, but we&rsquo;re proud of you,&rdquo; she added,
with a happy smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just afraid I won&rsquo;t make good; that&rsquo;s
the only thing that scares me,&rdquo; confessed the
usually self-reliant Janet. &ldquo;Everything out
there is going to be so strange and as actresses,
I&rsquo;m fearful that Helen and I will be about the
worst that ever struck Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; smiled her mother encouragingly,
and after Janet mentally reviewed some
of the pictures she had seen, she decided that
quite likely her mother was right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Her father arrived home promptly and they
passed more than an hour at a leisurely dinner,
visiting about a score of different incidents,
none of them important in themselves, but all
of them important in that they kept them
around the dinner table, prolonging their last
dinner hour.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s father finally looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better dress, dear. The westbound
plane leaves Rubio at eleven o&rsquo;clock and there&rsquo;s
no reason to rush the trip over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached into his coat pocket and drew
out a small case which he handed to Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a little present mother and I want
you to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet opened the case with hands that shook
visibly. Inside was a tiny wrist watch with a
thin, silver chain to go around her wrist. It
was a beautiful creation of watchmaker&rsquo;s skill
and Janet looked up with just a trace of a tear
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have
done this after giving me the trip to Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to have something to keep
time by so you can get to the studio on time.
Maybe I should have gotten you an alarm
clock,&rdquo; grinned her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I packed one in her trunk,&rdquo; smiled Mrs.
Hardy. &ldquo;Now hike and get into your things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Janet, tremendously happy and so thrilled
she felt she was walking on air, hurried up to
her room. After a quick bath, tapered off
with a cool shower, she started dressing. Her
outfit was new from the silken underthings to
the sensible but attractive summer linen suit.
The skirt, snug and well tailored, fitted beautifully
and a small but bright blue tie added
a note of color to her heavy, white silk shirtwaist.</p>
<p>The night air was warm and Janet decided
to carry her coat. There was no use in putting
it on and getting it mussed until necessary.</p>
<p>Standing in front of her dressing table, Janet
looked around her room and a queer little lump
caught in her throat. It was such a pleasant
room; she would miss it, she knew, in the
months to come.</p>
<p>Then her father called and she caught up
the small traveling bag she was to carry on
the plane, snapped out the light, and hurried
down stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step right along,&rdquo; her father warned, and
they hastened into the car and rolled around in
front of the Thorne home down the block.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Henry Thorne, pacing up and down the
porch, called to his wife and Helen, who appeared
almost immediately. Both carried small
overnight cases. As they came down the walk
to the street, Henry Thorne turned off the
lights in the house, locked the door, and followed
them.</p>
<p>Now that the time of departure was near
there seemed little to say. They had talked of
it for so many hours it hardly seemed possible
that they were on their way.</p>
<p>John Hardy sent his big car over the road
at a smooth, effortless pace. The lights of
Clarion dropped behind and they sped through
the open country where there were only the
occasional lights from farmhouses to mark the
blackness of the night. Later there would be
a moon.</p>
<p>Tonight they were in the heart of the mid-west
and to Janet it was almost incredible that
by noon tomorrow they would be in the city
made famous by the movies.</p>
<p>When they reached the airport at Rubio several
hundred cars were parked near the entrance
for the coming and going of the night planes
always brought out a crowd if they arrived before
midnight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Henry Thorne, who had their tickets, took
them into the office to have them validated.
When he returned he announced that the plane
would arrive in 25 minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good tail wind up high tonight
and they&rsquo;re stepping right along,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>A field attendant took their bags and stowed
them on a small luggage cart.</p>
<p>They talked almost aimlessly and Janet suddenly
felt very empty and more than a little
afraid of what her reaction would be when she
got into the plane and the ground started dropping
away from her.</p>
<p>Then a ripple of excitement ran through the
crowd and she heard someone call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the plane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the east twin stars suddenly appeared,
coming rapidly and very low, and then she
heard the steady beat of two powerful motors.
Like some great bird of prey, a-wing in the
night, the silvery monoplane swung over the
field, circled sharply, and dropped down far
out on the runway and rolled smoothly toward
them, its propellers flashing in the bright rays
of a floodlight which bathed the entire field in
a mantle of brilliant blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Janet watched the scene with fascination.
The ground crew rolled a small platform up
to the door of the passenger cabin and a girl,
not much older than herself and dressed in a
smoke grey suit with a jaunty overseas cap
perched on a mass of brown curls, stepped out.
After her came several passengers, alighting for
a bit of air and to stretch their legs before
settling down for the long flight over the plains
and into the higher altitudes that would take
them over the Rockies.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s mother hugged her hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss you, dear. Write often and remember
to do your best if you get a chance in
any pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, mother,&rdquo; she promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Janet. Hit the line hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tackle it with all I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; he said with a confidence
that Janet wished she could have felt.</p>
<p>Then Helen&rsquo;s father touched her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to go,&rdquo; he said, and Janet and Helen
walked toward the plane while the Thornes
said a final word of goodbye to their old
neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seats four and five on this side,&rdquo;
said the stewardess as the girls reached the plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Helen went in first with Janet close at her
heels. The interior was much like a bus,
thought Janet, and she found her seat unusually
comfortable.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s father and mother took seats across
the aisle from the girls and the stewardess came
along and snapped on the safety belts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take them off as soon as we&rsquo;re
away from the field,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>The landing stage was pulled away, the
starters hummed deeply as though struggling
with stubborn motors, and finally the mighty
engines burst into a deafening roar, but were
soon throttled down.</p>
<p>Lights in the cabin were turned low and
Janet, pressing her face close to the small, round
window, could see her father and mother standing
on the ramp. She waved, and they waved
back. Then the plane started forward, rolling
smoothly along the concrete. When it came
to the crushed rock runway it bumped
slightly, but before Janet knew it they were
in the air and when she looked down again, the
field was several hundred feet below. She was
actually on her way to Hollywood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br /><i>Chapter XVIII</i>
<br />HELLO, HOLLYWOOD!</h2>
<p>Janet and Helen found that by leaning close
together they could converse but with the
steady beat of the engines in their ears, a sense
of drowsiness soon overtook the girls and they
relaxed in their chairs. Janet dropped into a
deep sleep that was not broken until their plane
dropped down at Cheyenne well after midnight
to change pilots and refuel.</p>
<p>Here the stewardess offered them a selection
of fruit and Janet ate several oranges with
relish. Then they were off again, meeting the
sunrise east of Salt Lake City with the most
glorious panorama Janet had ever seen unfolding
beneath her eyes.</p>
<p>After that they swung southwest in an almost
direct line for Los Angeles, climbing
dizzily over the Sierras and then dropping
down into lower California.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Helen glanced at her watch and Janet, still
unused to her own, followed suit. They would
be at the Grand Central airport in less than
half an hour.</p>
<p>Helen, leaning back, cried, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost
there,&rdquo; and Janet nodded happily.</p>
<p>It seemed almost on the echo of Helen&rsquo;s
words, although it was actually minutes later,
when the plane wheeled and settled gently
down on the runway of a huge airport.</p>
<p>Janet, looking eagerly from the window,
saw a group of cameramen standing at the gate
which led to the field. There must be some
celebrity on their own plane or on a ship due
in soon. She scanned the passengers in their
own cabin. None of them appeared unusually
famous and she decided the cameramen were
there to meet some other plane.</p>
<p>A landing stage was rolled up the moment
the plane stopped and the stewardess opened
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; said Helen&rsquo;s father.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be a bit stiff after this long ride. You
girls want to look your best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Janet stood up and smoothed out her skirt.
It had remained remarkably fresh and the
heavy silk shirtwaist showed only a few
wrinkles. Her jacket would cover that up
and she got that garment down from the rack
over her head. Helen, who had worn a brown
silk suit, had fared almost as well, and after
a hurried glance into the mirrors in their handbags,
both girls pronounced themselves ready
to see what Hollywood looked like.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s father and mother were out of the
plane first with the girls close behind them.</p>
<p>A uniformed airport employee nodded to
Mr. Thorne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had your bags put in your car,&rdquo; he
said, and Janet saw the famous director hand
over a bill.</p>
<p>The cameramen were still clustered at the
gate and instead of looking for the arrival of
another plane, seemed to be watching them
as they advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mr. Thorne,&rdquo; greeted one of them, a
chunky little fellow half hidden behind a huge
camera. &ldquo;Have a nice trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, Joey. Couldn&rsquo;t have been better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get any fish?&rdquo; another one called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guess,&rdquo; smiled Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s far enough,&rdquo; said the photographer
called Joey. &ldquo;Just line up with the girls in the
middle. What&rsquo;s the idea trying to sneak in
on us like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; parried Mr. Thorne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Ace publicity office just tipped us off
that you were coming in this noon with a
couple of girls from the midwest and that you
think they&rsquo;re a couple of great film possibilities.
I don&rsquo;t call that playing very fair with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the office phoned and said I was bringing
in a couple of new stars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Now girls, smile a little. We
won&rsquo;t bite even if the cameras do look big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet and Helen, more than a little perplexed
by the sudden turn of events, couldn&rsquo;t
help smiling while the photographers clicked
their machines.</p>
<p>Then several reporters, who had remained in
the background until the photographers were
through, pushed ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us the dope, Mr. Thorne&mdash;who they
are, where you found them, what you have in
mind for them? Do you really think they&rsquo;re
good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; asked Henry Thorne slowly.
&ldquo;Good? They&rsquo;re two of the finest possibilities
that ever struck Hollywood. Boys, you don&rsquo;t
know how enthusiastic I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think they&rsquo;ll be big box office?&rdquo; one reporter
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they&rsquo;re box office
attractions right now and they are going to be
under my personal management and supervision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet chuckled quietly for she could see the
trend of Henry Thorne&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure, we&rsquo;ll admit they&rsquo;re good,&rdquo; said
another reporter, &ldquo;but who are they and where
did you find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Thorne paused a moment as though
deciding a question of tremendous importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, of course I hadn&rsquo;t expected
the office would tip you off on my arrival.
I&rsquo;d rather planned on slipping in quietly
and giving these girls a chance to get used
to Hollywood, but I suppose I might as
well tell you now. I want you to meet my
daughter, Helen, and her friend, Janet
Hardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reporters and photographers stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding us!&rdquo; one of them protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very serious,&rdquo; replied Henry Thorne.
&ldquo;You boys let yourselves in for this. I&rsquo;ve
always played fair with you and you thought
I was pulling a fast one on you so I let your
imaginations run along for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;re not new stars?&rdquo; asked one
photographer, who had taken unusual care to
get some excellent shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say they weren&rsquo;t. Now here&rsquo;s
actually the story. The girls graduated from
high school last week and this trip west is a
present to them. Both of them have brains,
better than average looks, and both of them
can ride. Billy Fenstow is going to put them
into his next western, but whether they&rsquo;ll be
any good is another question. I&rsquo;m willing to
bet that they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer called Joey looked at
Janet and Helen critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll string along with you,&rdquo; he decided.
&ldquo;Those girls look like winners to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks Joey. I&rsquo;ll remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time you have a picture scoop,&rdquo; Joey
retorted.</p>
<p>The Thornes and Janet went on to a waiting
sedan where a driver was ready to whirl them
to the home Henry Thorne maintained in
Hollywood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was quite an experience,&rdquo; grinned
Helen. &ldquo;We almost became celebrities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just another fool stunt of the publicity
office, but I guess it didn&rsquo;t do any harm,&rdquo; admitted
Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Half an hour&rsquo;s ride took them to a comfortable,
sprawling bungalow set well back on a
side street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living in an apartment, but when
I got the idea of bringing you back with me I
leased this place,&rdquo; Henry Thorne told his wife
and daughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve installed George, my
negro cook, and there ought to be something
in the way of lunch ready for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bungalow was delightful with a tremendous
living room clear across the front
and two long wings to the rear, one housing
the dining room, kitchen and servants&rsquo; quarters
while the other contained a series of bedrooms
with baths between. At the rear, flanked by
a high hedge, was a medium sized swimming
pool with a diving tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, this is wonderful,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care now whether I ever get before a
camera. I&rsquo;ll be happy right here, spending my
days in that pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Thorne took charge, made instant
friends of George, the smiling cook, and assigned
the bedrooms, Janet and Helen sharing
one large room with twin beds. It was at the
very rear of the house with a door that almost
opened onto the pool, which pleased the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Clean up and we&rsquo;ll have lunch. George
informs me that it will be ready in fifteen
minutes,&rdquo; said Helen&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a swim?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in?&rdquo; asked Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pool, silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hear it&rsquo;s even against California laws
to go in a pool in your birthday suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot. Of course we&rsquo;d put our suits in
the trunk and I suppose it will be a couple of
days before they arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a more prosaic shower, they felt tremendously
refreshed and the luncheon which
George had prepared was delicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See about a maid at once to do the housework,
mother,&rdquo; said Henry Thorne, &ldquo;and with
George to do the cooking you can have a little
fun, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want something to do,&rdquo; protested
Mrs. Thorne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be plenty just keeping track of
Janet and Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to attend a premiere
of a new picture at the Queen&rsquo;s Court tonight?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the
Queen Court?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the newest of the deluxe motion picture
theaters here. You&rsquo;ll see a lot of stars.
What do you say now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count us in,&rdquo; declared Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we wear? Our trunks aren&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;ll take you shopping this afternoon,&rdquo;
promised Henry Thorne. &ldquo;Or better,
I&rsquo;ll take you around to Roddy at the studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a mind reader. Who&rsquo;s Roddy?&rdquo;
Helen asked.</p>
<p>Her father looked at her in astonishment.
Then grinned. &ldquo;Sure, you wouldn&rsquo;t know
Roddy. Well, he&rsquo;s a thin little fellow, almost
bald, but he creates the most sensational clothes
worn by the stars at our studio. His credit line
on the screen is always signed Adoree, but that&rsquo;s
just for publicity. Roddy wouldn&rsquo;t be a good
name for a creator of ultra fashions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ll have Adoree do dresses for
us for tonight?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not call him Adoree or he&rsquo;ll
stick you full of pins. He&rsquo;s just plain Roddy
around the studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s throat suddenly felt dry. Here, on
her first day in Hollywood, she was to have
a gown created by a famous designer and attend
a premiere at the Queen&rsquo;s Court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br /><i>Chapter XIX</i>
<br />GORGEOUS GOWNS</h2>
<p>Henry Thorne telephoned for an appointment
with Roddy and then drove the girls to
the studio.</p>
<p>The Ace plant, one of the largest in Hollywood,
was built in a rambling Spanish style.</p>
<p>Where most automobiles were stopped at
the main gate, Henry Thorne sent his car rolling
right on through and the gatekeeper waved
and smiled. He stopped at a small office and a
boy hurried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rexler wants to see you at once. It&rsquo;s
about your next picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Thorne scowled a little as he said,
&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll be along in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the girls, he explained, &ldquo;Rexler
is the general manager and I&rsquo;ll have to see him,
but I&rsquo;ll take you to Roddy first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The creator of famous styles had his office
and workshop in a rambling, one story white
stucco building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Roddy looked just as Henry Thorne had
promised he would and Janet thought a good,
strong wind might blow the little man away.
But she liked him instantly, for his eyes
twinkled when Henry Thorne explained his
mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d like to have them look like real
stars tonight?&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea,&rdquo; grinned Henry Thorne.
&ldquo;Maybe the publicity office wasn&rsquo;t wrong in
sending out the photographers and reporters
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roddy stepped back and surveyed Janet and
Helen with cold, analytical eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice hair, even features, not too heavy and
not too thin, trim ankles,&rdquo; he said, half to himself
and half out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave them with you, Roddy. I&rsquo;ve got
to see Rexler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Thorne nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear they need another of your smash
hits,&rdquo; said the designer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean smash up or smash down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up. You never do flops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was years ago when I was only a
tailor. Go along now,&rdquo; added Roddy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
work to do with these girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took them back into his private fitting
room and called for silks and satins by the bolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something vivid for you,&rdquo; he told Helen,
taking a great bolt of crimson velvet and fashioning
it around her with dexterous hands,
pinning it here and there. Before Janet&rsquo;s eyes
he created a gown, stepped back, shook his head,
changed a pin or two, and surveyed his handiwork
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not perfect, but it will do for a hurry up
job,&rdquo; conceded Roddy.</p>
<p>Then, with a bolt of silver cloth, he quickly
fashioned a waist length cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too much makeup tonight,&rdquo; he told
Helen. &ldquo;Just a touch of color to take off the
pallor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned to Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a little harder,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;Brunettes are always easier to design for than
blondes, but I am glad you are not an artificial
blonde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet smiled, but said nothing and Roddy
called for various fabrics, finally deciding on
a sheer, vivid blue and a cape of gold cloth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For you,&rdquo; he told Janet, &ldquo;more color in
your cheeks. It will be needed with this blue.
Use a blue band to tie your hair, but do not
curl it any more than the natural wave it now
has. Both of you carry white gloves and it
will be better without bags. I shall be proud
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet and Helen felt very much like fairy
princesses as they left the designer&rsquo;s office. In
less than an hour they had seen stunning gowns
created. True, they had to be put together,
but they did not doubt that this would be done
in time, for Roddy had a certain magic in his
hands and his energy seemed to flow out to
the others who worked with him.</p>
<p>They waited for a time for Helen&rsquo;s father
to return and when he finally arrived there was
new enthusiasm in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re assigned to a new picture,&rdquo;
said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, dear. I start work on the script
tomorrow. The first draft is ready, but I always
like to sit in on the finishing touches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it going to be?&rdquo; asked Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kind of picture I&rsquo;ve always wanted to
do, an epic of the air, a story of the air mail,
but on broader, more sweeping lines than anything
else ever attempted. We need one more
big picture to bolster up the production schedule
for next year and I&rsquo;ve drawn the assignment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s father was as happy as a boy with a
new bicycle, and he hummed to himself half
the way home.</p>
<p>Suddenly he burst out. &ldquo;I forgot all about
your dresses. How did you get along with
Roddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s grand, and we&rsquo;re all fixed up. Mine
is crimson velvet and Janet&rsquo;s is some divine
shade of blue. I have a silver cape and she has
a cloth of gold cape. Oh, he planned everything
for us, even telling us just how much
makeup to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Roddy. He&rsquo;s a fine friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove on in silence for a time before
Helen&rsquo;s father spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be getting absent minded,&rdquo; he said
as they turned into the drive at the bungalow.
&ldquo;I ran into Billy Fenstow at the administration
building at the studio. He said to send you
to see him tomorrow morning. He&rsquo;s going
to start shooting on a new western next
week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things,&rdquo; said Janet, &ldquo;are happening too
fast. We only arrived this noon and have
already been fitted for gowns. Tonight we
go to a premiere and tomorrow we meet a director
who may give us places in his next pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Hollywood for you,&rdquo; grinned
Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br /><i>Chapter XX</i>
<br />AT THE PREMIERE</h2>
<p>After a leisurely dinner that evening they enjoyed
a quiet half hour beside the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time; let&rsquo;s take a swim.
The trunks arrived this afternoon and mother&rsquo;s
found our suits,&rdquo; said Helen, and Janet seconded
the idea at once. It had been a hectic
day and the water would relax them.</p>
<p>They had trim one-piece suits, Janet&rsquo;s of
cool green and Helen&rsquo;s a sharp blue. For
twenty minutes they splashed in the water or
relaxed and floated just as the mood struck
them. Finally Mrs. Thorne called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s less than an hour before we must start
for the premiere,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Janet and Helen climbed out of the pool,
rubbed themselves briskly with heavy towels,
and hastened into their bedroom.</p>
<p>Large boxes were at the foot of each bed and
from them they drew the gowns which Roddy
had created.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Dressing that night was one of the thrills
Janet would never forget. The costume was
complete for just the right undergarments had
been sent by the designer. The hose were the
sheerest gold, with gold slippers to match,
while Helen&rsquo;s accessories were silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like a fairy princess and it&rsquo;s hard
to make myself believe that this is all real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s enjoy every minute of it. We
may wake up and find that it is all just a
dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet looked at herself in the mirror. She
was sheathed in blue silk, ankle length, with
just enough of a slit in one side to show her
dainty, silken ankles. Helen helped her tie a
blue ribbon around her hair and watched
while Janet applied rouge judiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine the lights will be bright as we go
into the theater,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;so remember
what Roddy said about the color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In turn Janet helped Helen, fastening the
crimson velvet dress. Like her own, it was
a sheath of material with Helen encased
inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll be able to sit down. Dad
may have to hire a truck and drive us to the
theater in it. I&rsquo;d hate to have this gown all
mussed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine looks awfully tight, but it feels very
comfortable,&rdquo; confessed Janet. &ldquo;Oh, I feel
grand&mdash;simply grand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ready?&rdquo; called Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>They caught up their capes and threw them
around their shoulders with just the right touch
of abandon. Even the gloves had been provided
in the boxes sent by Roddy.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Thorne were waiting for them
in the living room, Helen&rsquo;s mother looking
very beautiful in a brown velvet gown while
her father was distinguished in his dinner
jacket.</p>
<p>Henry Thorne caught his breath as he looked
at the girls in Roddy&rsquo;s gowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew Roddy was a wonder worker, but
I didn&rsquo;t know he could perform miracles. I&rsquo;d
hardly know you if I saw you any place else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a real compliment, Dad,&rdquo; smiled
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something I thought you&rsquo;d like to
see.&rdquo; He handed a copy of one of the evening
papers to them. On the front page was one of
the pictures taken at the airport with Janet and
Helen between Mr. and Mrs. Thorne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Famous Director Brings Daughter and
Friend West to start Their Careers in Movies,&rdquo;
was the caption over the picture. Underneath
the story said: &ldquo;Moviedom will get its first
chance to see Henry Thorne&rsquo;s daughter, Helen,
and her companion, Janet Hardy, tonight at
the premiere at the Queen&rsquo;s Court. Both girls
are slated for movie careers if their screen tests
turn out all right. Their initial r&ocirc;les will probably
be in a new western which Bill Fenstow is
casting now and plans to put into production
next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look pretty much &lsquo;midwesternish&rsquo; in
that picture,&rdquo; observed Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if you do? There are too many
Hollywood types. What we need in pictures
is fresh faces on girls who have ability. Come
on now, we&rsquo;ve got to hurry or we&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big sedan was in the drive and Helen&rsquo;s
father had summoned a driver he employed
when he needed a chauffeur to drive them that
evening.</p>
<p>They turned out of the side street on which
they lived into a main boulevard and whirled
rapidly toward the Queen&rsquo;s Court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Janet, attending a movie premiere for the
first time, felt her heart quicken as she saw the
blaze of light which marked the front of the
theater.</p>
<p>The whistle of a traffic officer slowed them
down and the driver was forced to produce a
card before they were allowed to go past the
police lines. The sidewalks were lined with
people, anxious for a glimpse at some Hollywood
notable.</p>
<p>The car fell into line behind several others
and Janet caught her first glimpse of the theater.
It was magnificent white marble, with
the entrance an open court and down this court
the honored guests had to walk, running the
gamut of the stares of hundreds who backed
the police lines.</p>
<p>Their car pulled up under a canopy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, girls. Take your time and enjoy
it. Don&rsquo;t be stiff. It&rsquo;s just like going to
the Idle Hour back in Clarion,&rdquo; said Helen&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>He stepped out first, assisted Mrs. Thorne
and then turned to the girls. Janet heard the
master of ceremonies, standing at the microphone
nearby, announce, &ldquo;Henry Thorne,
most famous of the directors for Ace productions,
Mrs. Thorne, their daughter, Helen, and
Janet Hardy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Janet stepped out into the glare of the floodlights.
For just a moment a terrific wave of
stage fright gripped her. Then she saw smiling,
friendly faces, and she smiled back. Flashlights
boomed as the photographers worked.</p>
<p>The announcer beckoned to Henry Thorne.
&ldquo;Just a word, Mr. Thorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the director shook his head. &ldquo;This is
the girls&rsquo; night,&rdquo; he smiled, shoving Helen
toward the microphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can say,&rdquo; gasped Helen, &ldquo;is that I&rsquo;m
tremendously happy to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the announcer. &ldquo;And
now, Miss Hardy, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like all of the smiles,&rdquo; said Janet simply,
and a burst of applause came back from the
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; whispered Henry Thorne and
they started down the long walk past the sea
of faces.</p>
<p>Janet felt supremely confident, perhaps it
was just knowing that her gown and accessories
were perfection, and more than one compliment
on her costume came from the packed
masses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>In the grand foyer there were film stars on
every hand, some of them stopping for a
moment to talk, and as Helen&rsquo;s father introduced
the girls to all of these, Janet thought
she detected several frankly unfriendly stares
from some of the actresses, who seemed to be
little if any older than they were.</p>
<p>Then the picture started. Actually Janet
saw very little of it. She was too busy drinking
in the beauty of the theater and straining
to catch glimpses of stars who had arrived late.</p>
<p>When they left the theater, various groups
congregated in the foyer for brief visits and
Janet saw a tubby little man, looking ill at ease
in his dinner suit and mopping his bald head,
struggling to reach them. He kept his eyes
quite frankly on Janet and Helen as he neared
them, but there was nothing offensive in his
stare. He grabbed Henry Thorne&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Henry, are these the girls?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Billy. Sure. I want you to meet
my daughter, Helen, and Janet Hardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;you want to be nice
to this scamp. He&rsquo;s in charge of the western
unit and it will be his decision on whether you
get into the cast. In other words, meet Billy
Fenstow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None other and none such,&rdquo; grinned the
affable little director. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
me you had a couple of stars in tow?&rdquo; he chided
Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to take a chance on them
and promise them parts right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The creator of western pictures looked a
little surprised. &ldquo;Well maybe not for sure.
Tell you what. I&rsquo;m going home and make some
changes in my script. I&rsquo;ll build up some
stronger parts for the girls. Can they act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy, I don&rsquo;t know. I saw them one night
when I thought they could, but you&rsquo;ll have to
find out for yourself. Now I&rsquo;m going to take
them home and see that they get some sleep or
they won&rsquo;t be able to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I met you tonight,&rdquo; said Billy earnestly.
&ldquo;See you in the morning,&rdquo; as Helen
and Janet moved toward the car.</p>
<p>He watched them through shrewd eyes, and
if Janet could have turned around she would
have noticed that Billy Fenstow was looking at
her in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; whispered the little
director. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s got just what I want
for the new pix. Gosh, I wish this was morning.&rdquo;
He jammed on his soft, black hat and
went out in search of a taxi.</p>

<h2 id="c21"><br /><i>Chapter XXI</i>
<br />SCREEN TESTS</h2>
<p>Despite the excitement of the premiere, Janet
and Helen were up early. Mrs. Thorne, tired
from the trip, decided to remain in bed until
later and Helen&rsquo;s father had already gone to
the studio, but not before leaving a note directing
them on where to find Billy Fenstow.</p>
<p>Helen scanned a morning paper for an
account of the premiere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a paragraph about us,&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of the most stunningly gowned girls
seen at the Queen&rsquo;s Court last night were Helen
Thorne, daughter of Director Henry Thorne,
and Janet Hardy, a friend from the midwest.
It is rumored their gowns were special creations
of Adoree. Both girls are to get film tests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must clip the picture in last night&rsquo;s paper
and the story this morning and send them to
dad and mother,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>While Janet clipped out the items she
wanted, Helen telephoned for a taxi and they
were soon speeding toward the studio.</p>
<p>The driver looked at them a little suspiciously
as he slowed down at the main gate of
the studio. Evidently he had seen too many
girls like Janet and Helen get turned away, but
Helen produced a note from her father which
gained them instant admission. They paid
the cab driver and a boy was assigned to direct
them to Billy Fenstow&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>They found the director of the westerns at
an office well to the back of the lot and he
greeted them warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might just as well make a test the first
thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a camera crew over
on stage nine where there&rsquo;s an old interior that
hasn&rsquo;t been struck. You girls any lines you can
go through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only from our senior play,&rdquo; confessed
Helen.</p>
<p>Billy Fenstow looked aghast. &ldquo;That sounds
pretty bad, but we&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stage nine was one of the smaller sound units
on the Ace lot, but the director had a camera
crew, the sound men and an electrician awaiting
their arrival.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>He tested the lights quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just walk onto the set, do your lines and
action, and forget about the rest of us,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take part of it, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s knees felt very weak and when she
touched Helen&rsquo;s hand it was damp with a chill
perspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful,&rdquo; whispered Janet. &ldquo;I wish
your Dad could be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Helen fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, girls,&rdquo; urged the director, and
Janet and Helen, who had already agreed on
the scene, started their lines. The action and
words were simple, but both of them were
scared stiff and they acted like wooden people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Billy Fenstow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
human. I won&rsquo;t bite and I don&rsquo;t expect you to
be world beaters. Now try that over and
loosen up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet laughed a little and Helen found a
handkerchief and wiped the palms of her hands.
Both of them felt better. The lights brightened
until it was impossible to see the camera crew;
it was more like being on the stage of the gym
with Miss Williams over in the wings with her
prompt book in her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Both girls entered into the spirit of their bit
the second time, talking and acting as they had
the night of the class play. For the moment
they forgot the camera crew and failed to hear
the soft whirring of the camera as Billy Fenstow
signaled the cameraman to pick up the sequence.
They ran through the scene and the
lights dimmed.</p>
<p>Billy Fenstow stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was better. We shot it and I&rsquo;ll have it
put through at once. There&rsquo;s a couple of others
have a final word on the casting and they&rsquo;ll
want to see the test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will it be ready?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight. Suppose you bring your father
over at eight and we&rsquo;ll send it through with
rushes of other stuff that&rsquo;s been taken today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here,&rdquo; promised Janet.</p>
<p>On their way out they overheard several
electricians talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the kids was Henry Thorne&rsquo;s girl,&rdquo;
said one. &ldquo;What did you think of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not bad looking, but their skit was
lousy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, I thought so too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen looked at Janet and for some reason
or other, felt like laughing. Why hadn&rsquo;t her
Dad warned them about the test? He should
have given them something to rehearse that
would have been impressive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>It was nearly noon when they reached home
and after lunch Janet sat down and wrote in
detail of the things that had transpired since
they left Clarion. In the letter she enclosed
the picture and the newspaper paragraph.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon Henry Thorne came
home, tired but elated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted with the first draft of the
script for the new picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen Mr. Fenstow?&rdquo; asked
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wasn&rsquo;t so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. You made out well enough.
What did he put you through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; explained Janet. &ldquo;He had
us do a scene from the high school play and we
felt like awful nit-wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; conceded Helen&rsquo;s father.
&ldquo;When will the test be ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fenstow said to come over at eight. He
said several others had to have a word about
the casting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. The supervisors always want the last
word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>After dinner they drove to the studio, Mrs.
Thorne accompanying them.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s father took them directly to the
projection room. Billy Fenstow was waiting
and half a dozen others were in the room. Most
of them spoke to Henry Thorne and he introduced
several to Janet and Helen, but Janet
couldn&rsquo;t remember their names.</p>
<p>Then the lights went out and they settled
back into comfortable leather-upholstered
chairs.</p>
<p>Scenes from a number of pictures in production
flashed before their eyes. Suddenly
Janet and Helen saw themselves on the screen,
moving and talking, and Janet dropped her eyes
for a minute. To her it looked pretty terrible,
but her voice was well modulated and pleasing.</p>
<p>After that the lights came on and Henry
Thorne went over to speak to Billy Fenstow.
When he returned a few minutes later Janet
couldn&rsquo;t even guess what the decision had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The action was punk,&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s father said
frankly, &ldquo;but the supervisors liked your voices.
You&rsquo;ve got good faces and figures. In other
words you report Monday morning and both
of you go into &lsquo;Broad Valley,&rsquo; Billy&rsquo;s next
picture.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br /><i>Chapter XXII</i>
<br />WESTERN ACTION</h2>
<p>In the days intervening Janet and Helen found
plenty to do. Billy Fenstow sent over scripts
of his new western and they had a chance to
familiarize themselves with the general theme
of the play. The story, briefly, was the efforts
of a band of ruthless men to gain control of
&ldquo;Broad Valley,&rdquo; a great cattle ranch which had
been left to young Fred Danvers by his father.
There was plenty of action, some gunplay,
and a love theme in which Fred fell in love with
the leader of the band of men who sought his
property. The theme was as old as western
pictures, but Billy Fenstow had a knack of
dressing them up and making them look new.</p>
<p>Janet and Helen reported at stage nine at
eight o&rsquo;clock Monday morning, Henry Thorne
driving them over himself. He left as soon as
they reached the lot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Nearly a score of people were clustered
around the chubby little director and he nodded
as Janet and Helen joined the crowd. Janet
nudged Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Curt Newsom, the western star.
I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s got the lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks nice,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;but older
than he appears on the screen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rather artificial blonde was seated at Billy
Fenstow&rsquo;s right, idly thumbing through the
sheaf of script from which the picture would
be shot.</p>
<p>Mr. Fenstow spoke sharply. &ldquo;Attention
everybody. All of you have had a chance to
study the script; all of you should be familiar
with the parts. We&rsquo;ll make plenty of changes
as we go along, but in general you know what
we&rsquo;re aiming at. We&rsquo;ve got two weeks assigned
for the shooting and that means we&rsquo;ll be done
in two weeks, and not three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around at each of them, then
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curt Newsom goes into the lead as Fred
Danvers and Miss Jackson will play the r&ocirc;le
of Ruth Blair, the girl he falls in love with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran on down the list. &ldquo;The green cousins
from the east who come to visit Bill will be
played by Janet Hardy and Helen Thorne.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Janet felt her heart bound. She actually
had a part and it mattered little that it was an
insignificant r&ocirc;le.</p>
<p>Bertie Jackson, the blonde in the chair,
turned and looked sharply at the girls, then
sniffed. &ldquo;I should say they would be well
qualified to play such r&ocirc;les.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Fenstow caught the sneer in her voice
and turned quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Miss Jackson, you don&rsquo;t have to
work in this picture if you don&rsquo;t want to.
There are plenty of blondes would jump at
the chance to play this lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, calm down, Billy. Just because one of
the girls is Henry Thorne&rsquo;s daughter, you don&rsquo;t
need to get on your high horse when I make a
harmless wisecrack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Helen had her own ideas about Bertie
Jackson&rsquo;s wisecrack and she resolved to watch
the pallid blonde. Bertie, if it served her own
purpose, was quite capable of doing any number
of mean tricks.</p>
<p>The morning passed rapidly with costume
assignments being made. There were a number
of interior shots of the ranch house which would
be necessary and these scenes had already been
erected on stage nine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Janet and Helen would have their first
scenes tomorrow, but they remained on hand
to watch the first shots of the picture and to
attempt to get acquainted with other members
of the company. Most of them were friendly
enough, but they seemed to feel that the girls
had deliberately been put into the cast through
Henry Thorne&rsquo;s influence and Helen voiced
her belief quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to expect that,&rdquo; admitted Janet,
&ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t need to let it spoil all of our fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever she might have thought of Bertie
Jackson from a standpoint of personality, Janet
had to admit that the actress was a thorough
workman and she went through her r&ocirc;le in an
easy and screen-appealing manner. In makeup
Curt Newsom appeared much younger than
the forty years he was willing to admit.</p>
<p>The next morning Janet and Helen reached
the lot early. Although not their first scene
in the picture, the first one in which they were
to be shot showed them arriving at the ranchhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Simple travelling costumes had been assigned
by the wardrobe department, but Roddy
stepped in and quietly added a touch or two
that made them distinctive. Janet could almost
hear Bertie Jackson hissing. It was an
unheard of thing for Roddy to pay any attention
to the costume worn by a minor character
in a western or any other character in a picture
of that type.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lines are simple, girls. You&rsquo;ve just
gotten out of a buckboard after a long ride
from the nearest railroad station. You&rsquo;re tired
and stiff and a little mad because Curt didn&rsquo;t
come to meet you. Janet, remember that
you&rsquo;re a little giddy and anything crazy you
do will fit in all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do plenty of that,&rdquo; said Bertie Jackson,
under her breath.</p>
<p>Billy Fenstow didn&rsquo;t believe in rehearsals. He
told his people what he wanted, then asked them
to do it, and started the cameras grinding. If
it was too bad, he had to shoot it over, but if
it was fair, he let it go, with the result that once
in a while he got some exceptional shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set, girls?&rdquo; asked the director.</p>
<p>Janet, her mouth dry, nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Camera!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>They stepped into the range of the cameras,
Helen in the lead and Janet, a rather vacant
stare on her face, following. There was a bear-skin
rug in front of the door and some way her
feet became tangled up in it and she pitched
forward, only the strong arm of Curt Newsom
preventing her from falling. Curt, a veteran
trooper, faked a line and Janet had enough
presence of mind to come back with a cue.
Then they went on with the scene, which was
extremely brief, ending with a cowboy,
laden with baggage, trying to get through the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it,&rdquo; waved Billy. &ldquo;What are you trying
to do, clown this?&rdquo; he demanded of the
red-faced Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Fenstow. You see, I slipped. I
didn&rsquo;t mean to do it,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it was, it was a nice bit of
action and I think we&rsquo;ll keep it. It ought to be
worth a laugh or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning they left early by bus for
a location back in the mountains. Billy Fenstow
had every ranch possibility listed in a small
black book and this was one of his favorites.
He had used it several times, but a studio carpenter
crew, by going out several days in advance,
had changed the barns and corrals
enough to disguise them. They arrived shortly
before noon and a delicious meal was waiting
for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Janet and Helen had little to do for the next
two days, most of the shots being confined to
action on the range, with the camera, mounted
on a special truck, racing ahead of the pounding
horses while the broad valley resounded to
volleys of blank shots as the cowboys, led by
Curt Newsom, chased and were chased by the
marauders.</p>
<p>Then Janet and Helen got their chance in a
comedy sequence called for their first riding.
Neither of them felt any qualms until they
were mounted. Then their horses seemed to
explode and both girls hung on for their lives,
their faces registering surprise in no uncertain
terms.</p>
<p>Helen lost her grip and flew through the air
to land in an undignified position in a cloud of
dust. Janet, either more fortunate or a better
rider, clung on for another minute, then found
herself dumped into the open water trough.
Splashing furiously and sputtering at a great
rate, Janet got her head above water. Her
hair was plastered to her head and she was soaking
wet. The camera crew, in spite of their
roars of laughter, had kept grinding away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great stuff, Janet. You&rsquo;ve got a natural
born sense of comedy,&rdquo; chuckled Billy Fenstow
as he wiped the tears out of his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like I&rsquo;m all wet as an actress,&rdquo; admitted
Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Getting all wet may
make you one,&rdquo; countered the director. &ldquo;Get
into some dry clothes. We&rsquo;re through with
this sequence, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The days on location passed swiftly and in
the main pleasantly. Curt Newsom took an
interest in the girls, which only heightened
Bertie Jackson&rsquo;s jealousy. He taught them several
tricks about riding and they spent every
extra hour in the saddle.</p>
<p>One of the last sequences to be filmed at
the ranch was one calling for a wild ride by
Janet to take news of a raid on the ranch to the
sheriff&rsquo;s office in a near-by town.</p>
<p>With the camera crew in the truck ahead,
the action started. Janet rode hard, but was
careful to keep in camera range. Suddenly she
felt her saddle slipping and she grabbed desperately
at the mane of the galloping horse.
Alarmed by the looseness of the saddle, the
beast increased its stride and Janet, a stifled
scream on her lips, plunged headlong. She
felt the shock of the ground as she struck and
then a mantle of merciful darkness descended
upon her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br /><i>Chapter XXIII</i>
<br />ON THE SCREEN</h2>
<p>Curt Newsom was the first to reach the unconscious
Janet. He picked her up, almost
without effort, and ran to the car in which Billy
Fenstow had been following the action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step on it, Billy. This girl&rsquo;s had a bad fall,&rdquo;
he said, and the director swung the car quickly
and sped back toward the ranchhouse. Helen,
mounted, galloped after them and the rest of
the company, including the camera crew,
trailed along.</p>
<p>When Janet regained her senses she was lying
on a bed in the ranchhouse with Helen,
her face expressing her anxiety, bending
over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Janet faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your saddle came loose and you took a
header,&rdquo; explained Curt. &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get up and take a few steps and then
I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied Janet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better stay quiet for a few more minutes.
We&rsquo;ve got a doctor coming out to look you
over,&rdquo; advised Billy Fenstow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s nothing really wrong
with me, except perhaps I&rsquo;m clumsy,&rdquo; replied
Janet.</p>
<p>Just then one of the cowboys tiptoed in and
whispered something to Curt Newsom. Janet
caught a flash of anger in his face as he turned
and followed the cowboy outside.</p>
<p>The doctor arrived within a few minutes
and made a thorough examination for possible
injuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a liberal supply of bumps and bruises,&rdquo;
he decided. &ldquo;Better take it easy for a day or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Janet managed to smile
when the doctor had departed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
I spoiled another sequence and you&rsquo;ll have to
shoot it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; replied Billy Fenstow.
&ldquo;The camera got every bit of action and I&rsquo;ll
work it in somehow. Any time I let a swell
shot like that go unused you can write &lsquo;finished&rsquo;
after my name. Stay in bed the rest of the day.
The schedule of scenes you were in is practically
completed anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Helen was in and out the rest of the day for
there were several shots in which she appeared
and it was late afternoon when she came in to
stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curt Newsom is on the warpath,&rdquo; she said
slowly as she sat down beside Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sore about my mussing up that scene?&rdquo;
asked Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s been looking at the saddle and
says someone tried to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s voice was flat.</p>
<p>Janet sat up in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone tried to kill me?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Tears welled into Helen&rsquo;s tired eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is all a mess,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We never
should have come out here. There are too
many intrigues and jealousies among those established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me just what you mean?&rdquo; insisted
Janet.</p>
<p>Helen waved her hands helplessly. &ldquo;Curt&rsquo;s
found out that the saddle girth was almost cut
through. That&rsquo;s the reason your saddle came
loose and you were pitched out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he have any idea who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, he isn&rsquo;t saying anything, but I
heard him tell Billy Fenstow that this is the
last picture he&rsquo;ll work in with Bertie Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that means he suspects Bertie?&rdquo;
Janet pondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could take it that way if you wanted
to, and personally I think Bertie is fully capable
of some despicable stunt like that. I&rsquo;m glad
shooting on this picture is practically over. I&rsquo;ve
seen all of Bertie I ever want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem as though she would do anything
like that, though,&rdquo; said Janet. &ldquo;But,
after all, Bertie&rsquo;s determined to get ahead and
I expect she&rsquo;s wholly unscrupulous when she
thinks anything or anyone may be blocking her
way. But why should she pick on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we came in as absolute greenhorns
and got fairly good bits. She&rsquo;s afraid we may
be pushed ahead too fast because of Dad&rsquo;s position
with the company. I think it&rsquo;s all plain
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; conceded Janet.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly watch myself when I&rsquo;m around
Bertie from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet felt much better the next morning.
She was still stiff and sore, but was able to walk
with only a moderate amount of discomfort.</p>
<p>It was the final day of shooting for &ldquo;Broad
Valley&rdquo; and a certain tenseness gripped the
whole company. Billy Fenstow was determined
to finish on time and they worked like
mad through the long, hot hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Janet had to do another riding sequence,
and she went about it gamely, although every
bone in her body ached as her horse galloped
at a mad pace across the broad valley and into
the rolling hills behind it. Then it was done.
The picture was &ldquo;in the can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supper was served at the ranchhouse and
after the meal, in the soft twilight of the summer
evening, they piled into the bus that was
to take them back to Hollywood.</p>
<p>There was little conversation on the way
back to the city. Some of them were completely
worn out by the strain of working
against time for the last few days and a number
dozed as the bus, striking a concrete road, rolled
smoothly and swiftly toward Hollywood.</p>
<p>The days had been exciting and even thrilling
for Janet and Helen&mdash;an experience they
might never know again and both girls knew
they would come to treasure the recent days
highly.</p>
<p>Janet wondered what would be in store for
them in Hollywood. Would they win other
r&ocirc;les or were they through? It would depend
on the verdict after &ldquo;Broad Valley&rdquo; had its
screening before the studio executives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>The lights of Hollywood glowed and they
pulled up in front of the studio. Some of the
actors and actresses had their own cars; others
took busses and only a few signalled for waiting
taxis. Janet and Helen were among these.</p>
<p>Henry Thorne was waiting for them when
they reached home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All done?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Helen nodded wearily. &ldquo;The picture is
and we may be too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it depend on how our work shows
up whether we get any more r&ocirc;les?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;but I
could push you into some minor parts in other
films.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re wrong, Dad. We don&rsquo;t want
that any more than you would want to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, dear. I did give you
a boost with Billy and if you didn&rsquo;t make good
on &lsquo;Broad Valley&rsquo; there&rsquo;s little more that I can
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a time. Helen&rsquo;s mother,
who had been to a neighborhood picture house,
came home and they went into the dining room
where a cold lunch was ready for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you had some unusual experiences,&rdquo;
said Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had a few falls,&rdquo; admitted Janet.
There was no use in voicing their suspicions
about Bertie Jackson.</p>
<p>The next four days were spent in sight-seeing
around Los Angeles, in a trip to Catalina Island
and several swimming expeditions at Malibu.
Then came a call from Billy Fenstow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re screening &lsquo;Broad Valley&rsquo; at the
studio tonight,&rdquo; he informed them. &ldquo;Better
come on out. It&rsquo;s at eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the news they had been waiting for,
but now that the actual screening was to take
place, both girls felt nervous and upset. Helen&rsquo;s
father and mother insisted on coming with
them, &ldquo;to enjoy the triumph or share the sorrows.&rdquo;
Henry Thorne smiled and Janet later
wondered whether he had advance information
on the outcome of the picture.</p>
<p>The small auditorium in which the picture
was screened was well filled that night with
most of the members of the cast on hand, including
Curt Newsom and Bertie Jackson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The lights were out and the picture started.
Janet read the title: &ldquo;&lsquo;Broad Valley&rsquo; with Curt
Newsom and Bertie Jackson, directed by William
Fenstow; produced by the Ace Motion
Picture Corporation.&rdquo; Then came the cast of
characters and well toward the bottom of the
list she found her name. Her heart leaped and
she held Helen&rsquo;s arm close. What a thrill it
was to actually read her own name in the cast
of characters of a film.</p>
<p>Then the action started, the story of Curt
Newsom&rsquo;s fight to hold title to his ranch.</p>
<p>Almost before Janet and Helen knew it they
were in the picture, the midwestern cousins
arriving for a visit and in spite of herself Janet
chuckled as she stumbled over the rug. It
DID look wholly accidental.</p>
<p>Then for a time they were out of the action,
coming back again in the riding sequence in
which Janet was dumped into the watering
trough. This entire bit of action had been kept
in the film and she heard several hearty chuckles
as she went headlong into the trough.</p>
<p>After that came the wild ride in which Janet
was pitched from her horse and the final victory
of Curt over his enemies. &ldquo;Broad Valley&rdquo; came
to a close with Curt winning the affections of
Bertie Jackson and Janet felt her distaste for
the actress growing as she watched the final
fadeout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>The lights in the projection room flashed
up and Henry Thorne turned to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice work,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean it, Dad?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, honey. I think both of you
handled your parts very well and Janet added
a couple of top notch comedy incidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t intentional,&rdquo; Janet assured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that explains why they look so natural.
Billy will be a sap if he cuts them out
in the final version.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not a sap,&rdquo; said Billy Fenstow, who
had quietly joined them. &ldquo;How about my next
western? Think you could stand a few more
weeks in my company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; demanded Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough so that I&rsquo;m promising you parts
right now. In fact, we&rsquo;ll pay you $75 a week
instead of the $50 a week you got for this first
picture. How does that sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; put in Henry Thorne, &ldquo;especially
if the girls can give you some more
comedy as good as the stuff they put into this
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait a minute,&rdquo; protested the little
director. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t work on budgets that run
up to half a million. I&rsquo;ve got to watch my pay-roll.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was only kidding, Billy. But honestly,
the girls ought to be worth a hundred a week.
You&rsquo;ll only use them a couple of weeks and
that&rsquo;s pretty cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make any promises about a hundred
a week,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;but you can count on another
job if you want to join the company for
my next western.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re in right now,&rdquo; decided Helen,
and Janet nodded her approval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br /><i>Chapter XXIV</i>
<br />&ldquo;KINGS OF THE AIR&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The next morning Janet found an interesting
paragraph in one of the morning papers, which
had been written by a reporter who had attended
the screening of &ldquo;Broad Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the pleasant surprises about this
latest Billy Fenstow western was the work of
Helen Thorne and Janet Hardy, two newcomers.
Miss Thorne is the daughter of the famous
director and Miss Hardy is a friend of hers from
the middle west. Although playing minor
r&ocirc;les, both girls handled their parts well with
Miss Hardy providing several of the best comedy
touches seen in a western by this reviewer
in some months. It is reported that both will
be in the next western which the prolific Fenstow
will produce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet read the brief comment three times,
then clipped it out of the paper, wrote a brief
note home, and sent the clipping to her folks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Later in the day they received their final
vouchers from the studio for work on &ldquo;Broad
Valley.&rdquo; Altogether the two weeks work on
the picture had netted them $100 apiece, more
money than either of them had ever earned in
a similar length of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder girls come to Hollywood,&rdquo; said
Helen as she looked at the check.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but remember that we&rsquo;re lucky. We
didn&rsquo;t have to break down any barriers; we
didn&rsquo;t have to make introductions. The way
was all smoothed out for us. Look at those
poor kids over at the casting office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen turned in the direction Janet pointed.
Half a hundred young men and women were
waiting patiently in a line before the window
of the casting office. Most of them were
rejected; only one or two were allowed
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happens to the average seeker
of fame in the films,&rdquo; said Janet. &ldquo;So many,
with some beauty and high hopes, come out
here expecting to make a success, and then almost
starve. Of course they get a bit once in
a while, but it&rsquo;s hardly enough to buy their
food much less their clothes and all of the other
necessary things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, of course,&rdquo; admitted Helen.
&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Dad we&rsquo;d never have had
a look-in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were having lunch that noon at the
studio restaurant with Helen&rsquo;s father. They
were waiting when he arrived. Accompanying
him was a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, I want you to meet Mr. Rexler, general
manager of the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general manager, tall, thin and exceedingly
nervous, greeted them cordially, then
seemed to forget that they even existed for he
talked business from the moment they reached
their table until lunch was over. But in spite
of that Janet and Helen enjoyed the hour.
Some of the most famous stars on the Ace lot
were lunching there that noon and Janet and
Helen enjoyed watching them come in.</p>
<p>The general manager, a man of quick
thought and action, suddenly turned toward
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw &lsquo;Broad Valley&rsquo; the other night. Congratulations
on a nice bit of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour passed quickly, with Helen&rsquo;s father
and the general manager continuing their conference
in the executive&rsquo;s private office in the
administration building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad and Rexler are having trouble over
the story for the new air picture,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;I heard him talking with mother just last
night. They can&rsquo;t agree on the final version.
Dad was going over it last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to read it,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it for you if he brings it home tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Janet had her chance to scan the
script of Henry Thorne&rsquo;s next picture. The
tentative title was &ldquo;Kings of the Air.&rdquo; The
action was fast and stirring, the panorama of
the story covering the entire transcontinental
route of one air mail system and Janet could
understand that there was material here for a
really great picture. But there was something
lacking&mdash;a crashing climax that would make
the spectators grip their seats.</p>
<p>Henry Thorne, watching Janet as she laid
the script aside, spoke quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can suggest a suitable climax you
can just about name your own ticket on our
lot,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a race for a contract?&rdquo; suggested
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too old; it&rsquo;s worn out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not have the plane going through
with valuable papers which are needed for say,&rdquo;
Janet paused, &ldquo;a naval conference at Washington,
on the outcome of which may hinge the
fate of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Thorne started to reject the idea, but
halted. &ldquo;Where did you get that idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something I read in a paper several months
ago suggested it,&rdquo; admitted Janet. &ldquo;Navy
planes were racing across country with a naval
envoy and they got held up somewhere in
Wyoming on account of bad weather. You
could have your mail plane take over there after
the navy ship was grounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would give the navy a black eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other solution could be worked out
then,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, that&rsquo;s not a bad idea. It would
require some rewriting of the script, but we&rsquo;ve
got to have a terrific air race against time and
the elements in this thing for a conclusion. I&rsquo;ll
talk it over with Rexler in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Helen&rsquo;s father changed his mind.
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll talk it over with him tonight if he&rsquo;s
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He phoned the general manager&rsquo;s home,
found Rexler there, and informed him he was
coming over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what he thinks of your suggestion,&rdquo;
he flung at Janet as he hurried out the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we wait up and learn the outcome
of the conference?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;Just think
if they should decide to work out a climax along
the line you suggested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for waiting up, but I&rsquo;m afraid my
suggestion is pretty weak,&rdquo; said Janet.</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Thorne decided to
retire and urged the girls to do likewise, but
they insisted upon awaiting the return of
Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Midnight passed and finally the clock struck
one <span class="sc">A. M.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too sleepy to stay up any longer,&rdquo; admitted
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait half an hour more,&rdquo; urged Janet,
and Helen agreed.</p>
<p>It was 1:20 when Director Thorne reached
home. There were hollows under his eyes and
he looked unusually tired, but in his eyes
burned a spirit of elation that fatigue could not
beat down. Mrs. Thorne, in a dressing gown,
joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the decision?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to work out the climax along
the line suggested by Janet,&rdquo; replied her father.
&ldquo;Rexler called two of the writers down and
they&rsquo;re working right on through the night on
a new treatment for the whole script. It must
be done tomorrow noon. We&rsquo;re to start shooting
next week. It means another bouquet for
you, Janet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet blushed. &ldquo;It was just luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t luck. It was good, clear
thinking and the ability to recall a worthwhile
incident. Incidentally, both of you are going
into the cast of &lsquo;Kings of the Air&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dad, you can&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just that,&rdquo; retorted her father, &ldquo;and
I wasn&rsquo;t the one who suggested it. Rexler
insists that you be included. It&rsquo;s his way of
trying to repay Janet for her suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that means we&rsquo;ll get another chance
in a picture,&rdquo; said Janet, and she felt her heart
beating like mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it does and you&rsquo;ll be in the biggest
feature the Ace company is producing this
year,&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s father assured them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br /><i>Chapter XXV</i>
<br />THE STARS VANISH</h2>
<p>Janet and Helen did get r&ocirc;les in &ldquo;Kings of the
Air&rdquo; and even though they were very minor
parts, both girls were elated. They were cast
as waitresses in the restaurant which served the
pilots at the main western terminal of the air
mail line.</p>
<p>Almost every contract player on the Ace lot
was in it, with a good, substantial r&ocirc;le going
to Curt Newsom, who was taken out of Billy
Fenstow&rsquo;s western unit long enough to play
the part of a bitter field manager. Even Bertie
Jackson got a part as a gold-digger who was out
to get all the information she could from the
pilots and was suspected of selling secrets to a
rival air line.</p>
<p>Janet and Helen saw little of Helen&rsquo;s father
for the next few days. He was immensely
busy on the details of the production and a
complete airport was set up out in the California
desert for one of the major sequences
would revolve around this lonely outpost on
the air mail route.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>The sequences in which Janet and Helen
were to appear were shot at Grand Central at
Glendale, actually in the field restaurant and
were among the first to be taken.</p>
<p>Janet had only four lines and Helen had
three. All of them were in a brief scene with
Curt Newsom and his encouragement helped
them through for it was hard work under the
glare of a brilliant battery of electrics. What
made it all the harder was that Mr. Rexler was
with the company the day this particular sequence
was shot, but somehow they managed
to get through with it. After that they were
free to stay with the company and watch
the rest of the shooting schedule until Billy
Fenstow called them back for his next
western.</p>
<p>It was during the second week of shooting
that things started to go wrong. There were
innumerable little delays that were maddening
in themselves and when a dozen of them came,
almost at the same time, even level-headed
Henry Thorne showed signs of extreme exasperation.
The cast was large and expensive and
a dozen planes had been leased. The daily overhead
was terrific and each day&rsquo;s delay sent the
cost of the picture rocketing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>When they went on location out in the desert
Curt Newsom, lunching with Janet and Helen,
gave voice to his fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This outfit is getting jitters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
heard this morning that one of the pilots found
several of his control wires half way eaten
through by acid. That&rsquo;s bad business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet, looking up from a dish of ice cream,
spoke slowly. &ldquo;Then that means someone
is deliberately trying to cripple the company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means someone is doing it. That flyer
pulled out; refused to take his plane off the
ground again and some good shots are already
&lsquo;in the can&rsquo; with his plane in it. Means they&rsquo;ll
have to get another plane and fix it up like his
or shoot over a lot of footage. Either one will
be expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Henry Thorne called the company
together. Their location was at the edge
of the ghost town of Sagebrush, and members
of the company were sheltered in the three or
four habitable houses which remained. All
of them had grumbled a bit, but there was
nothing that could be done about it for the
nearest town of any size was too far away to
make the drive back and forth daily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s father spoke plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been a series of accidents,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;These have slowed up production and
put us almost a week behind schedule. All of
you know what that means on a picture of this
size. I am convinced that someone in the company
is aiding in this sabotage and I am giving
fair warning now that this town will be patrolled
at night and that all equipment will be
watched. The guards are armed and have
orders to shoot first and ask questions afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all, but it started a buzz of conversation
that lasted nearly an hour. When the
company finally broke up to go to quarters,
Janet happened to be watching Bertie Jackson
and she saw the blond actress, slip between two
buildings and vanish into the night.</p>
<p>Helen was some distance away and Janet,
playing a hunch, followed Bertie at a safe distance.</p>
<p>There was no moon, but the sky was studded
with stars. The walking through the sand was
hard going, but noiseless, and Janet, keeping
low, could discern Bertie&rsquo;s silhouette.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Suddenly the older actress stopped and
whistled softly, a long, a short and a long
whistle. The sound could not have carried
back to Sagebrush and Janet, vaguely alarmed,
waited.</p>
<p>Almost before she knew it another figure
joined Bertie and she could hear the two conversing,
but she didn&rsquo;t dare move closer. The
newcomer struck a match to light a cigarette
and carefully shielded though it was, Janet was
close enough to glimpse his face. It was that
of a stranger. The match went out and the
night seemed darker.</p>
<p>Janet wanted to get closer, but as she
moved forward she stumbled over something
in the dark and plunged headlong into the
sand.</p>
<p>Before she could regain her feet she heard a
muttered exclamation and knew she had been
discovered.</p>
<p>Then the thin beam from a shielded flashlight
struck her face.</p>
<p>Janet knew her only chance was to run for
it and she tried to rise, but her feet were entangled
in a tough creeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! She may scream!&rdquo; warned
Bertie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Janet opened her lips to cry out, but before
she could do it, the man with Bertie leaped forward
and thrust a heavy hand against Janet&rsquo;s
mouth. Suddenly the world went black, the
stars vanished, and she dropped into the sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br /><i>Chapter XXVI</i>
<br />BOMBS FROM THE SKY</h2>
<p>It was later in the evening when Janet was
missed. Helen thought her companion had
gone to visit some other member of the company
and it was well after ten o&rsquo;clock when
she became alarmed and started making inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for someone?&rdquo; asked Bertie Jackson,
who seemed to be everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Janet for several hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s got a date with a boy friend in
the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janet hasn&rsquo;t any boy friend and she
wouldn&rsquo;t be dating in the desert,&rdquo; snapped
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; retorted Bertie,
but as she turned away a sneer distorted her
vapid face.</p>
<p>Helen finally communicated her fears to her
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone over the entire camp and no one
has seen Janet for at least an hour and none of
them are sure it was that recent. I&rsquo;m worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Thorne, busy working with one of the
writers on a difficult bit of script that needed
smoothing up half way dismissed Helen&rsquo;s fears
with a wave of his hand. Then he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure she&rsquo;s not in camp?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive, Dad. Do you think anything
terrible has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. She&rsquo;s probably walked out
into the desert and has gone too far. I&rsquo;ll rout
out some of the men and we&rsquo;ll start a searching
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt Newsom was one of the first to answer
the call and he muttered to himself when he
heard the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s trouble brewing,&rdquo; he told Helen.
&ldquo;You stick close to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Curt?&rdquo; asked Helen,
her voice filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean this picture promises to be too big
and someone is trying to throw a wrench in the
proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some rival company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be that. I&rsquo;m not saying, but I&rsquo;m
certainly going to keep my eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Under the brisk commands of Helen&rsquo;s
father, the ghost town awoke. Men who had
been asleep were routed out, cars commandeered,
and parties swept away over the desert
in search of the missing girl.</p>
<p>Curt Newsom, who had brought several
horses with him, preferred to ride and Helen
went with him. Curt saddled the horses and
they swung away into the desert together.</p>
<p>Across the almost level floor of the
desert they could see the cars swinging in great
circles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t find anything,&rdquo; said Curt, and
after that they rode on in a silence broken only
by the steady shuffling of the horses through
the sand.</p>
<p>At intervals they stopped and Curt&rsquo;s great
voice boomed through the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better turn back to camp,&rdquo; the cowboy
star finally advised. &ldquo;Maybe some of the
others have news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when they gathered in the ghost town,
Helen knew that the search had been fruitless.</p>
<p>Each searching party brought back the same
report&mdash;no trace of the missing Janet had been
found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone try to get some sleep now,&rdquo; said
Helen&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll resume the search at
dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen went to the room assigned to her and
lay down, fully dressed, to try and rest in the
short interval before dawn. But sleep would
not come and thoughts raced through her head.
Something was decidedly amiss and, like Curt
Newsom, she could now sense impending disaster
to the company. Just what it was or how
it would strike she could not determine, but a
terrible uneasiness gripped her.</p>
<p>Breakfast was served at dawn. Most of the
women in the company were on hand to aid in
the search, but Henry Thorne called only upon
the men.</p>
<p>Half a dozen cars were manned and they
swung out again to comb the desert floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; said Curt Newsom to Helen.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ride. If there are any tracks, we&rsquo;ll be
able to follow them easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall, well-built cowboy star swung into
his saddle and they trotted away between two
tumbledown houses of the ghost town.</p>
<p>Shadows of the morning were long and
heavy, for the sun was just topping the mountains,
but Helen, riding close behind the cowboy,
glimpsed a footprint in the sand. She
reined in her horse and called to Curt, who
whirled quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been through here,&rdquo; she said,
pointing to where the sand was fairly hard
packed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone could have left a print like that,&rdquo;
replied the cowboy star. &ldquo;Your nerves are getting
the best of you, Helen. Steady up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled and they turned again toward the
desert, riding at a steady pace and scanning the
sand intently for anything unusual.</p>
<p>They were less than a quarter of a mile from
the old town when Curt pulled his horse up
sharp and leaped from the saddle to bend down
and scrutinize a tough creeper which had been
pulled out of the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get down here, Helen. Here&rsquo;s something
the others have missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen dismounted and ran to Curt&rsquo;s side. In
his hands he held a tough section of the creeper
and his eyes were fastened on a brown stain.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like someone got caught in this and
scratched,&rdquo; said Curt, trying to pass the remark
off lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it might have been Janet?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been,&rdquo; agreed the cowboy
star. &ldquo;Look back toward the village. This
is in a direct line and although you may not
have noticed it, we&rsquo;ve been following footprints
all of the way. Two came out and only
one returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen looked at him, her eyes showing her
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then someone in the company was responsible
for Janet&rsquo;s disappearance!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; snapped Curt. &ldquo;The first thing is
to find Janet; then we&rsquo;ll catch up with whoever
was responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better tell the others?&rdquo; asked
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not used to tracking; I am.&rdquo; He
grinned. &ldquo;Even if I am a movie cowboy most
of the time, I know a few tricks about the
range and the desert. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remounted and Curt led the way,
scanning the ground closely. Even Helen, as
inexperienced as she was, could see the signs
now. Someone had left deep prints in the
sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was either an awful big man or he was
carrying someone,&rdquo; said Curt. &ldquo;One thing, he
won&rsquo;t be able to go far.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>The trail led toward the hills back of the
ghost town and it was evident that the man
they were trailing had rested frequently. Curt
saw another of those brown stains, but he made
sure that Helen did not see it for there was no
use in increasing her fears.</p>
<p>The trail led on, perhaps half a mile altogether,
and ended suddenly in a tiny depression
where the sand was smooth and hard.</p>
<p>Curt dismounted and made a minute survey
of the bowl. The trail came in all right, but
there were no tracks going out. In the center
were two marks, about four inches wide and 12
or 14 feet long, but that was all. Beside one
of these was a tiny smudge of black and Curt
got down on his hands and knees and sniffed
keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>Curt shook his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell yet and
there&rsquo;s no use in guessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mopped his forehead with a large bandana
and scanned the heavens. The sun was blazing
down and shortly the temperature in the little
bowl they were in would be stifling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get out of here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Janet? Where can she be? We&rsquo;ve followed
the trail but it&rsquo;s simply vanished.&rdquo; The
questions tumbled from Helen&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could answer them all,&rdquo; said Curt.
&ldquo;Maybe I can later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode back to the ghost town at a brisk
trot and Curt cornered Henry Thorne and told
him of their discovery. Then he led a searching
party of half a dozen into the hills back
of the town while the other members of the
company assembled for the day&rsquo;s work under
the boiling sun.</p>
<p>Helen attempted to join the searching party,
but was told it was no place for a girl so she
went with the company out into the desert
where the airport had been laid out and a
dummy hangar erected.</p>
<p>Shooting went ahead on schedule until just
before noon when someone shouted an alarm
and they turned toward the ghost town. The
remaining houses were rapidly being consumed
by flames and before they could reach them
there was no hope of saving anything, including
a number of valuable cameras, sound equipment
and hundreds of dollars worth of costumes.</p>
<p>Henry Thorne fairly blazed for he knew
now that a deliberate effort was being made to
stop the production of &ldquo;Kings of the Air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>But before they had recovered from that disaster,
another befell with startling swiftness.
There was a dull boom from the valley and they
turned to see a fast, black plane swinging over
the set on the desert. A cloud of dust was rising
near the hangar and as they watched, another
explosion echoed in their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That guy&rsquo;s bombing the set!&rdquo; yelled a
cameraman, leaping into a car.</p>
<p>The third bomb was a direct hit and the
hangar collapsed. Over to the right were half
a dozen planes which were being used in the
picture and the unknown flyer turned his attention
toward these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he blows them up, we can figure a hundred
thousand dollar loss right there,&rdquo; groaned
Helen&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>But the unknown flyer had reckoned without
the resourcefulness of Curt Newsom. The
lanky cowboy, riding hard by in the hills, had
heard the first explosion and the roar of an airplane
motor. They saw him flash out into the
desert at a mad gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy; someone stop him!&rdquo; cried
Henry Thorne, but there was no one near
enough to reach Curt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Helen saw him drag a rifle from the scabbard
on his saddle. The flyer was apparently disdainful
of the lone rider for he dropped another
bomb. It missed the planes by only the narrowest
of margins and the pilot of the black ship
swung around for another try. He swooped
toward Curt and waved jeeringly as Curt
leaped from the saddle.</p>
<p>They were too far away to hear the report of
the rifle but they could see the little puffs of
smoke from the muzzle. Suddenly the black
plane heeled sharply, its motor sputtering. The
pilot shot over the side, his chute billowing out
and Curt, jumping back into the saddle, rode
like mad toward the hills.</p>
<p>The plane gyrated uncertainly, then dove
toward the ground. It struck with a tremendous
explosion as the bombs still aboard let go.</p>
<p>Helen saw Curt whirl back into the valley
and sweep down on the flyer, who had landed
in a tangle of cord and silk from the parachute.
All thought of resistance was gone from the
flyer&rsquo;s mind and the cowboy captured him
easily. By the time the others arrived, Curt
had the situation well in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a confession out of this guy will
solve our troubles,&rdquo; said the cowboy star as
Henry Thorne stared at the flyer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got to say for yourself.
Who employed you?&rdquo; demanded the director.</p>
<p>The flyer was sullen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking. I
want an attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curt rocked back and forth on his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t talk?&rdquo; He grinned, but it was
a mirthless grin that struck terror to those who
watched. Curt was living in real life the r&ocirc;le
he had played so many times on the screen.
With a quick jerk his lariat was free from the
saddle and before the flyer knew it, he was in
the coils of the rope and his feet had been
jerked out from under him.</p>
<p>Curt swung into the saddle, twisted the rope
around the saddle horn and looked down on the
helpless man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captive shook his head.</p>
<p>Curt spoke to his horse and the magnificent
sorrel moved ahead slowly, dragging the captive
after him.</p>
<p>After bouncing over the desert floor for a
rod, the flyer cried for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk; I&rsquo;ll talk. Get this rope off quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll tell us what you did with that
girl last night and where we can find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captive nodded emphatically and Curt
shook the rope loose.</p>

<h2 id="c27"><br /><i>Chapter XXVII</i>
<br />THE SHOWDOWN</h2>
<p>When Janet regained consciousness she was
aware of a roaring that filled her ears. It was
as though a great storm was sweeping down
upon her. Then, from the motion, she realized
that she was in an airplane. Her head
ached terrifically and she made no attempt to
move for several minutes.</p>
<p>As her eyes became accustomed to a dim
glow of light ahead she could distinguish the
figure of a man at the controls in the small
cabin they were in.</p>
<p>Janet shifted her weight and the man turned
instantly, focusing a flashlight on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still or I&rsquo;ll crack you again,&rdquo; he
warned and from the fierceness of his voice
Janet knew that he would not hesitate to carry
out his threat.</p>
<p>The pulse of the motor lessened and she
felt the craft sinking, to settle smoothly into
a little circle of light. It was then that
she learned they were in an autogiro.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Her captor opened the door and ordered her
out.</p>
<p>Still with her head throbbing wildly, Janet
managed to get out. There was a bad scratch
on her left leg that had bled rather freely.</p>
<p>To her anxious questions, the flyer gave only
the same answer, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out later,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet was forced to allow her hands to be
tied behind her and then was led to a small
shelter tent. There was a blanket on the
ground and the flyer tossed another over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any attempt to escape,&rdquo; he
warned.</p>
<p>The portable electric light which had guided
the autogiro down into the basin was snapped
off and Janet passed the remainder of the night
in desperate anxiety, wondering what was happening
back at camp and the meaning of her
abduction.</p>
<p>With the coming of dawn she hoped to learn
more about the camp, but she was doomed to
disappointment for her captor appeared and
dropped the canvas fly which covered the front
of the tiny tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>It was well after daylight when she heard
another plane approaching. It landed nearby
and a few minutes later she heard men&rsquo;s voices,
one of whom she recognized as that of the flyer
who had brought her there. Then the plane
which had just landed roared away and it was
shortly after that when Janet heard a series of
booming explosions.</p>
<p>Suddenly her tent flap was jerked roughly
aside and her captor, a stocky, heavy-set man
with a mass of black hair, ordered her to her
feet. Janet struggled to get up, but she was
numb from being in one position so long. The
man half cuffed her upright and then hurried
her toward the autogiro.</p>
<p>The motor of the queer looking plane responded
instantly and they rose almost straight
out of the valley, which Janet judged must be
some distance from Sagebrush. As they gained
altitude she looked across the desert. Although
it was several miles away, it seemed almost a
stone&rsquo;s throw to Sagebrush, hardly recognizable
now with the flames still consuming the
few structures left in the village. Janet saw
that the set for the desert airport had been destroyed.
But what was more important was
the swarm of planes which were climbing off
the desert floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Like angry hornets they were buzzing
around. Suddenly one of them shot toward
the autogiro and the rest followed. Janet
heard her own pilot shouting in anger, but the
autogiro was slow and the movie planes were
around it almost instantly.</p>
<p>In the foremost was Curt Newsom and Janet
felt her blood chill as she saw the rifle in Curt&rsquo;s
hard hands.</p>
<p>Under the warning muzzle of the gun, the
autogiro settled toward the floor of the valley
and in less than three minutes the other planes
were down around it while cars raced toward
them, clouds of desert dust rising in their wake.</p>
<p>Bertie Jackson was in the first car and when
she saw Janet her face blanched. Helen and
her father were in the same machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; asked Helen anxiously,
for Janet was white-faced and deep hollows of
fatigue were under her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little tired,&rdquo; confessed Janet. &ldquo;What
happened? Was this something in the plot I
wasn&rsquo;t supposed to know about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us where you&rsquo;ve been and why?&rdquo; said
Henry Thorne, and Janet briefly related the
events. She didn&rsquo;t like to do it, but there was
nothing else she could do under the circumstances
and her story implicated Bertie Jackson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s jealous, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; snapped Bertie.
&ldquo;The whole story is trumped up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Curt Newsom took a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look at this thing squarely. How
much were you and these two flyers paid to
slow up production on &lsquo;Kings of the Air&rsquo;?&rdquo; He
shot the question at Bertie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re impertinent,&rdquo; she blazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but you&rsquo;re likely to go to prison.
Setting fire to buildings is arson, you know.&rdquo;
There was no humor in his words and Bertie
looked from one to another in the group around
her. Each stared at her with scornful eyes.</p>
<p>Defiant to the end, she flung her head back,
&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this. You&rsquo;ll never work in another
picture for anybody.&rdquo; It was Henry Thorne
speaking, quietly and firmly, and Bertie turned
away.</p>
<p>The two flyers, the one who had abducted
Janet and the one who had bombed the set,
talked. Janet didn&rsquo;t hear the whole story, but
she and Helen learned enough to know that
another rival company was implicated. It was
Bertie who had set fire to the dry old houses in
Sagebrush and who had supplied the flyers with
information on the plans of the company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>When they finally returned to what little
was left of the village, Henry Thorne spoke
quietly to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry now,&rdquo; he assured Helen.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no more delays. We can erect
another set on the desert without too much loss
of time and we&rsquo;ll have to live in tents, but that
is endurable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to Janet, he surprised her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janet, I&rsquo;m going to put you in Bertie&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le.
We&rsquo;ll shoot the scene in the field restaurant
over again when we get back to Hollywood,
but I need someone right now to step into
Bertie&rsquo;s place and you can handle the part.
What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; promised Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will.&rdquo; Then Henry Thorne
hurried away to attend to one of the hundred
details that are the worry of a successful director
and Janet and Helen faced each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like &lsquo;Kings of the Air&rsquo; is going on
to a successful conclusion now,&rdquo; said Janet.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m happy that you are getting Bertie&rsquo;s
part. Do you suppose we&rsquo;re going to be able
to keep on in the movies?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; smiled Janet, &ldquo;is something I
couldn&rsquo;t even guess. If we don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll go home
this fall with the memories of the most thrilling
summer any two girls could have had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned to rejoin the rest of the company,
unaware of the further adventures in
Hollywood and in New York which were to
befall them before winter came.</p>
